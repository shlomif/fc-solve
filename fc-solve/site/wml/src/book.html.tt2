I have now placed what I had written online.

<h2>Recent Note (13-June-2006)</h2>

<p>
I have stopped working on the book after only finishing a few chapters, and
do not plan on resuming working on it in the near future. If you are interested
in learning more about Freecell Solver see the <a href="docs/">documentation
page</a>.

<p>
I am writing a book titled <i>Freecell Solver - Evolution of a C Program</i>
that would cover the development of Freecell Solver, and various lessons
I learned by working on it.
