<p>
This article will summarise how we
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)">benchmark</a>
two or more versions of our software to determine which version runs faster. It
may provide some insights for your benchmarking efforts, and we welcome further
insights into it.

<p>
This article aims to collect and share the insights we have accumulated from
benchmarking
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</a> which is a
CPU and RAM intensive software application written in C. It is written from
the point of view of benchmarking it on a modern
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">GNU/Linux</a> installation.

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/shlomif/shlomif-computer-settings/blob/master/shlomif-settings/home-bin-executables/bin/sudo_renice">sudo_renice</a> is a shell wrapper
for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_%28Unix%29">nice</a> and
<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/ionice">ionice</a> that runs the command
under optimal resource utilisation. This way it runs faster and gives less
variance in the results.
</p>

<p>
It is reproduced here:
</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
sudo nice -n-20 ionice -c1 -n0 sudo -u "$USER" "$@"
</pre>

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "same_sys", title = "Use the same machine and same operating system installation for both timings" %]

<p>
It is important to run both the "before" and "after" versions of the benchmark
on the same physical computer, with the same system installation and in
similar conditions - one after the other.

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "isolate", title = "Make sure the benchmarked process is practically the only thing running" %]

<p>
We noticed that running an X environment with a resource-heavy desktop
environment such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE">KDE</a>
Plasma, can slow down the program and skew the result. As a result, it is
a good idea to stop X and use a virtual console or a remote shell such
as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">ssh</a>, and use
a process monitor such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Htop">htop</a>
to make sure nothing else that consumes CPU or RAM is running (such as
system services or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)">daemons</a>,
or stale processes that were not killed).
</p>

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "not_overheated", title = "Make sure the system is not overheated" %]

<p>
We noticed that once the computer becomes overheated, the CPU is
being throttled and performance decreases. Make sure this is not the case
by making use of the "sensors" command from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lm_sensors">lm_sensors</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerTOP">PowerTOP</a>,
and perhaps by waiting a little using the UNIX
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_%28Unix%29">sleep command</a>.

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "run_several_times", title = "Run each benchmarked process several times" %]

<p>
Keep track of the results, and try to see which are generally (minimally,
on average, etc.) faster. Also see <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-il@cs.huji.ac.il/msg58950.html">some previous discussion</a> of it
on the Linux-IL mailing list.

[% WRAPPER h3_section id = "compile_flags", title = "Compile flags" %]

<p>
You should build both versions using CPU flags for maximal performance such
as <code>-O3</code>, <code>-march=native</code>, <code>-flto</code>,
<code>-fwhole-program</code>, and possibly
<code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profile-guided_optimization">Profile-guided optimization</a> may prove
useful as well.

<p>
One should link against a
<a href="http://blog.reverberate.org/2009/02/one-malloc-to-rule-them-all.html">fast malloc library</a>. <a href="http://goog-perftools.sourceforge.net/doc/tcmalloc.html">TCMalloc</a>
is the best performer for us, but your kilometrage may vary.
Other prominent mallocs, which are not mentioned in the first link, are <a href="http://locklessinc.com/">the Lockless Inc. one</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/r-lyeh/ltalloc">ltalloc</a>
