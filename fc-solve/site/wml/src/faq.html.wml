<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCell">Freecell (or “FreeCell”)</a>
is a single-player card game (which are generally known as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patience_%28game%29">“Patience” or
“Solitaire”</a>), where all the cards are played face-up at startup and where
no talon is used. There is more information about it in
<a href="http://www.solitairelaboratory.com/fcfaq.html">the FreeCell FAQ</a>
which is maintained by Michael Keller.
</p>

<p>
An automated solver for Freecell is a computer program that attempts to solve
layouts of Freecell: either initial deals, or often also mid-play states of the
game, and emit a solution to completion, or conclude that the layout could
not be solved by it. Freecell Solver is one such program, and it is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">open source</a>
under the permissive and common
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT/Expat licence</a>,
provided free-of-charge for download or use online, and sports a large number
of features. (See <a href="$(ROOT)/features.html">its features list</a>.)
</p>

<p>
One should note that Freecell Solver can solve several other variants of
solitaire that are similar enough to Freecell for us to provide support for,
but Freecell appears to be the most popular variant out of them, and the
name is kept for historical reasons.

<h3_section id="what_is_solitaire" title="What is Solitaire? Is it the Windows implementation of Klondike?">

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patience_%28game%29">“Patience” or
“Solitaire”</a> are any single-player card game, or at least those played
using the standard
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_playing_cards">French playing cards</a>.
One such solitaire variant is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_(solitaire)">Klondike</a>
which has become associated with card Solitaire in general, and
was implemented as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Solitaire">a game for
Microsoft Windows</a> under the name "Solitaire". Nevertheless, there are many
other variants of card Solitaire, and Freecell is one of them.
</p>

<p>
In some countries, "Solitaire" can also refer to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire">peg solitaire</a>.

<h3_section id="what_are_ms_deals" title="What is “Microsoft deal #NNN”? What is “MS deal #NNN”? What are the Microsoft Freecell deals?">

<p>
Microsoft shipped several implementations of Freecell for its Windows operating
systems called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FreeCell">“Microsoft
FreeCell”</a> which contributed to popularising the game. They dealt cards
with numbered deals using a shuffling algorithm based on inputting the number
of the deal into the Microsoft C Run time library
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator">pseudorandom
number generator</a>. The algorithm for dealing cards was made available by
Jim Horne, a Microsoft software developer who implemented Microsoft FreeCell.
</p>

<p>
While the original MS FreeCell only dealt deals in the range 1 to 32,000, these
deals can be extended up to a 31-bit number and were later extended by
<a href="http://cards.wikia.com/wiki/FreeCell_Pro">Freecell Pro</a> to 33-bits
dealing.
</p>

<p>
The Microsoft deals are considered canonical among Freecell researchers in
their studies of the game.

</h3_section>

<h3_section id="solve_all_games" title="Can Freecell Solver solve all the Freecell layouts?">

<p>
First of all, despite popular belief, a small percentage of the standard
8 columns+4 freecells
Freecell layouts are
<a href="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~bodla101/d.freecell/freecellhtml.html"><b>impossible</b>
to solve</a>, and even more deals are impossible with fewer than 4 freecells
available. What
Freecell Solver will do in this case is traverse the entire game graph (given
enough time and computer memory) and then report
“I could not solve this game.”
</p>

<p>
That put aside, some deals may be
<a href="#unsolvable_solution">inaccurately reported as unsolvable</a> with
the default heuristic. See <a href="#unsolvable_solution">the link</a> for
more information and for a solution.
</p>

<p>
Part of the confusion may have stemmed from the phrasing in the Microsoft
Freecell help file which read “It is believed (though not proven) that every
[Freecell] game is winnable.” which referred only to the 32,000 built-in deals
and proved to be false as well (because deal #11,982 turned out to be
impossible).
</p>

<p>
Some of the most famous impossible deals are:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
Microsoft Deal #11,982.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Recent versions of Microsoft Freecell contain two impossible deals numbered
-1 and -2 as a joke.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Theodore Pringle has constructed <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/fc-solve-discuss/conversations/messages/1472">a deal</a>
which is impossible to win with 8 freecells or fewer.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

</h3_section>

<h3_section id="a_move_seems_wrong" title="I think I found a wrong move in the solution? What can I do?">

<p>
While it is not unthinkable that Freecell Solver will have a bug and will
make a wrong move, it is extremely unlikely that that is the case. Some people
have reported that several multi-card moves are impossible, but as I
demonstrated to them, they were in fact possible.
</p>

<p>
One can find the maximal number of cards that can be moved as a sequence
in Freecell using the formula
<code>max_cards = (1 + num_vacant_freecells) * (2 ^ num_vacant_columns)</code>
(where “*” is multiplication and “^” is exponentiation.). One can also try using
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/expand-solitaire-multi-cards-moves">expand-solitaire-multi-cards-moves</a>
from the <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Games-Solitaire-Verify">Games-Solitaire-Verify CPAN distribution</a> (by the same author of Freecell Solver),
in order to filter solutions and produce ones with multi-card moves
expanded into many single-card moves. If you are on Microsoft Windows, you can
install <a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl</a> and run it.
</p>

<p>
Note that the <a href="$(ROOT)/js-fc-solve/">web-based solver</a> also has an
option to expand such moves and one can use it in most modern JavaScript-enabled
browsers without having to install any additional software on your computer.
</p>

</h3_section>

<h3_section id="abuse_of_fc_solve" title="I think I found an abuse of Freecell Solver. What should I do?">

<p>
We received a report or two about various people or companies distributing
Freecell Solver along with their products, and the answer is that it is:
1. Likely legal, 2. We don't mind, and 3. We encourage commercial and/or
proprietary use of the code or binaries.
</p>

<p>
Freecell Solver used to be distributed under the Public Domain, but was
relicensed to the permissive
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT/Expat licence</a> due
to the problematic and not globally accepted nature of the Public Domain,
especially in software. (See
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Licensing_and_Law/public-domain.html">the
page maintained by Rick Moen about it</a>.) As far as we know (and this is
not legal advice), the main legal and practical
difference between the public domain and the Expat licence, is that one should
keep attributing the original copyright holders as rightful holders (while
the licence of derivative works may be changed into any other). As far as
we are concerned, this is not something we want to enforce, but we still
recommend to follow this, to stay on the safe side of the law.
</p>

<p>
So unless someone sues us for damages for a problem caused by the program
or library (which violates the no warranty paragraph of the licence) everything
should be fine and the “abuse” of the program is acceptable.
</p>

</h3_section>

<h3_section id="what_are_the_uses_of_a_solver" title="What are the uses of a solver for Patience/Solitaire card games, such as Freecell Solver?">

<p>
Freecell Solver is unlikely to help in curing cancer, or solve world hunger,
but it still has some uses. One use is determining whether an initial layout
of a game, or a layout in mid-play is solvable or not so a human player can
know whether he needs to return to an earlier position. The default
configuration of Freecell solver may still report a small number of solvable
positions as unsolved, but that can be mitigated by passing some command-line
flags.
</p>

<p>
Another use of a Solitaire solver is to find solutions for difficult deals,
or attempt to find shorter solutions. Yet another use is to collect statistics
from a large number of random deals (say, the Microsoft Windows Freecell deals
or PySolFC’s deals), which is part of what Freecell researchers do.
</p>

<p>
Freecell 3D, a Freecell implementation for Windows, has also introduced a
“Race against the computer” mode of Freecell, which is an interesting challenge.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we have more recently started to investigate some “human/computer
collaboration”-based Freecell solving, where a human aided by a Solitaire
suite with a good solver integration can attempt to solve some difficult
deals (for both a human and a computerised solver), by pruning dead ends, and
by finding whether reached states are solvable. This provides a combined
solving technique, that is greater than the sum of both parts.
</p>

</h3_section>

<h3_section id="does_anyone_care" title="Does anyone care about this project? I think no one cares about it except you.">

<p>
The short answer is that: yes, some people care. As of November 2016, I received
over 900 E-mails about the project to my private inbox and my
<a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/fc-solve-discuss/info">fc-solve-discuss group</a>’s
folder also contains over 900 E-mails. Furthermore, some people to whom
I mentioned my solver in real life, expressed interest in it, in part due to
the fact that in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel">Israel</a>,
where I live, many people played it on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces">the
Israeli military</a>’s computers during their draft/etc. service. An
<a href="http://www.nrg.co.il/online/10/ART/782/006.html">internal survey</a>
conducted in 2004 found that it was the preferable game of 29% of the
surveyed soldiers - thanks to <a href="https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%A1%D7%9C">the Hebrew wikipedia page about Freecell</a> for the link. One should note that Israel has instated a draft for girls as well
as boys, so some of the people who were impressed were attractive females.
</p>

<p>
I have written <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/shlomi_fish/2013/03/ann-my-transition-from-software-developer-to-writerentertaineramateur-philosopherinternet-celebrity.html">a section
in a three-part essay</a> titled “How to achieve world domination” about that
and niche software in general.
</p>

<p>
Freecell may have been declining in popularity lately, but I expect interest
in it to continue for a while.
</p>

</h3_section>

<h3_section id="new_solver_is_too_slow" title="I started writing a solver for Freecell (of my own) but it is too slow. What can I do?">

<p>
The problem with many naïve Freecell solving programs is that, while they
can succeed in solving many Freecell deals, they may fail spectacularly in
the general case. Furthermore, Generalised Freecell (where there is an
arbitrary number of ranks) was shown to be
an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete">NP-complete problem</a>
and as a result, it is likely that no efficient solution for solving that
in the general case can be found (but it is possible that some good heuristics
can be devised).
</p>

<p>
You can try inspecting the code of Freecell Solver or one of the
<a href="$(ROOT)/links.html#other_solvers">other solvers</a> for insights, but
note that their code (and especially Freecell Solver’s) may be somewhat
complex and hard to understand for people with relatively little experience.
You can also pursue some of the
<a href="$(ROOT)/docs/">Freecell Solver documentation</a> as well as the
<a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/fc-solve-discuss/info">archives of
the fc-solve-discuss mailing list</a> for some insights and ideas.
</p>

<p>
Here are some general tips:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
Make sure that the positions in the graph of the game are represented as a
single segment of memory (normally a C struct) and can be compared for
equivalence easily (using <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte/memcmp">memcmp()</a> or a similar function).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Use an efficient data structure to hold the states in the collection such as
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash table</a> or a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree">self-balancing
binary search tree</a>. There are libraries implementing them for most
popular languages.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Often randomising the solution (see Freecell Solver's Random-DFS scan
which was inspired by a different solver called “Freecell Tool”) can help
a lot.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Freecell Solver makes heavy use of switch tasking: having several different
searches operate on the same board, until the first search yields a solution.
This normally yields a solution quicker than a singular scan.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Consider implementing moves as meta-moves: sequences of several single-card
and/or sequence moves that implement a certain ends. This can yield a solution
faster than using single-card moves (also known as atomic moves).
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Finally, note that we could use a helping hand with Freecell Solver, and the
authors of other open-source solvers may be happy for help as well, so if
you want to help to improve something more mature, then contact us.
</p>

</h3_section>

<h3_section id="integrate_fcs_into_program" title="May I integrate Freecell Solver into my program? If so - how?">

<p>
Yes, you can, as long as you accept the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT/Expat licence</a>. We
also would appreciate an acknowledgement and a link to the Freecell Solver
home page, in the About Dialogue, and in other places.
</p>

<p>
Now regarding how to integrate: please either use the
<code>freecell_solver_user_*</code>
API, or alternatively parse the output of <kbd>fc-solve</kbd>
with the <kbd>-p -t -sam -sel</kbd> flags. The <code>freecell_solver_user_*</code>
API is not documented at the moment, but should be self-explanatory, and there
are some examples of using it in the various solvers in the distribution.
One useful way to configure a solver handle is to use “fcs_cl.h”
which provides an API based on the Freecell Solver command-line and is more
convenient than issuing multiple lower-level API calls.
</p>

<p>
You can opt to put the solver on a separate thread, on a separate process,
or alternatively limit the iterations and increase it constantly, in a
pre-emptive multi-tasking fashion.
</p>

<p>
Good luck and please let us know if you run into any trouble, or,
alternatively, if you are successful.
</p>

</h3_section>

<h3_section id="solutions_are_too_long" title="The Solutions I got are too long. What can I do?">

<p>
You can try using a flares-based preset such as “video-editing” and
optionally add <kbd>--flares-choice fcpro</kbd> and <kbd>-fif 10</kbd>, where 10
can be replaced by a larger (or smaller) number. So the complete command would
be:
</p>

<pre>
pi-make-microsoft-freecell-board -t 24 | \
    fc-solve -l ve --flares-choice fcpro -fif 10 -
</pre>

<p>
If this still does not work to your satisfaction, you can try constructing
a specialised heuristic from the many command line options of Freecell Solver
that will yield something. There are some examples for those in the individual
flares and soft threads under the “Presets/presets” directory.
</p>

</h3_section>

<h3_section id="which_prog_lang" title="Which programming language (or programming languages) is Freecell Solver written in?">

<p>
The core Freecell Solver source is written in the GNU11 version of
the C11 standard of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29">C programming language</a>
(<code>-std=gnu11</code>), which is supported by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection">GCC</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang">clang</a> compilers
and compatible compilers. This
includes
the libfreecell-solver library, most of the user-facing executables
using it, and some other related code. Aside from that, there's quite a lot
of support code for testing (a.k.a: “quality-assurance”), automation, building,
results analysis, and other tasks, written in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl">Perl 5</a>,

and possibly some other languages. The git repository also contains code and
markup in other languages such as JavaScript.

Here are the estimated lines-of-codes-per-language statistics of running

</h3_section>

<h3_section id="why_in_c" title="Why is Freecell Solver written in C? Why not in another language?">

<p>
Part of the reason why Freecell Solver is written in C, is because the first
released version (version 0.2) was written in C, and it continued to be
maintained in this language. Other reasons are:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
C is fast and memory efficient.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
C is portable.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The bit-handling operators of C are utilised extensively in the Freecell
Solver source.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
As opposed to C++, C is easier to get right, is more of a “no-nonsense
language”, is less hyped, and does not encourage crazy or pointless
practices. Also see
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Freecell-Solver/slides/why_not_cpp.html">what
I’ve written about it previously</a>.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Here are a few other links I collected which speak against C++:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://lbrandy.com/blog/2010/03/never-trust-a-programmer-who-says-he-knows-c/">“Never trust a programmer who says he knows C++”</a> - by Louis Brandy.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://shlomif-tech.livejournal.com/63781.html">“C++ Joke”</a> - on
my technical blog.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="https://idkn.wordpress.com/2008/11/21/%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%98%D7%95%D7%98%D7%99-%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%94/">“Software-related Quotes”
on Ido Kanner’s blog</a>. His blog contains many
<a href="https://idkn.wordpress.com/?s=C%2B%2B">other entries</a> criticising
C++.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Nevertheless, I cannot guarantee that Freecell Solver’s code will remain
written in C forever, and that I won’t gradually convert it to C++ or a
different language. My main issue with using C++ right now is that I
(rationally) fear it will give me too much rope to hang myself, and
be too tempting to go wild with advanced features, as well as potentially
bring too many unexpected and hard-to-debug problems.
</p>

<p>
One final note is that the Freecell Solver C source has been compiled to
browser-side-compatible JavaScript using
<a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten">Emscripten</a>, so it can
be used inside a JavaScript-compatible browser. This was done for making
it easy to be tested and used, at the (usually not show-stopping) trade-off
of being slower than compiled-to-native-binary-code. Nevertheless, the C code
is still maintained directly, and the generated JavaScript code is not
idiomatic JavaScript.
</p>

</h3_section>

<h3_section id="unsolvable_solution" title="I found a solvable deal that Freecell Solver reports as unsolvable - should I report it to you?">

<p>
The default Freecell Solver heuristic may have a small number of deals that
are reported as unsolvable despite being solvable. However, you can use scans
based on atomic moves to rectify that. See <kbd>fc-solve --help-configs</kbd>
and the <a href="$(ROOT)/docs/distro/USAGE.html">USAGE.html</a> file for
more information.
</p>

</h3_section>

<h3_section id="is_fc_solve_completed" title="Have you completed/finished the work on Freecell Solver? Is it done yet?">

<p>
I am getting asked that a lot, and I find it a strange notion. It is similar
to asking if the <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> developers are done
working on KDE, or if the developers of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel">Linux kernel</a>
have completed the Linux kernel, or if the
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox browser</a>
is done. Freecell Solver is a fairly large and complex project and there is
still a lot of room for improvement, and while I sometimes take a break
from working on it, it does not mean I planned to have permanently stopped.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, I complete one task and call it a day, but it does not mean that
I plan to ever stop working on it. Perhaps when I tell people that
“I’m working on Freecell Solver” they assume that this work is temporary,
but it has been developed since the year 2000, while taking some breaks.
</p>

<p>
All that put aside, one should not conclude that Freecell Solver is an immature
project or is unusable, just like KDE, the Linux kernel, and Firefox are not
immature or unusable. Freecell Solver is not perfect (and will probably
never be) but it is still usable in its current state.
</p>

<p>
Also see <a href="http://shlomif-tech.livejournal.com/2011/03/12/">an
earlier blog post</a> about “Finished Projects, Maintained Projects and Those
that are Up For Adoption”.
</p>

</h3_section>

<h3_section id="wasnt_freecell_solved_yet" title="“‘Freecell Solver’? Hasn’t Freecell been solved yet?”">

<p>
This question shows a basic misunderstanding of what Freecell is, and the
purpose of a solver for it. Just to clarify the matters,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCell">Freecell</a> is a single-player
card game, with some rules about what constitutes a legal move, and since there
are 52 cards (Ace-to-King in the four suits), which are usually placed in
8 columns (although a different number is possible), there are about
1.75 × 10<sup>64</sup> distinct initial layout (according to the Wikipedia
page), and many more if we consider mid-play layouts.
</p>

<p>
The primary purpose of solvers such as this one is to attempt to solve any
arbitrary layouts, while optionally giving the moves to completion. Note
that due to the nature of the game, it may be
<a href="#solve_all_games">impossible and/or time consuming</a> for
some layouts, but hopefully the chance of this risk can be minimised
with the more advanced searches.
</p>

</h3_section>

<h3_section id="is_fc_solve_written_in_perl" title="Is Freecell Solver written in Perl?">

<p>
For some reason, some people assume that I (= Shlomi Fish) wrote Freecell
Solver in Perl. That may stem from the fact that I've written a lot of
Perl 5 code (see <a href="http://perlresume.org/shlomif">my “Perl Résumé”</a>
over at perlresume.org), but it is not, in essence, the case for Freecell
Solver.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the core C libfreecell-solver library, some of the command line
executables, and some other code, is written in
<a href="#which_prog_lang">the GNU11 version of the C programming language</a>,
and does not require the Perl runtime to be used.
</p>

<p>
It is true that the preliminary version of Freecell Solver (that was written
before the first “0.2” release and that can be found
<a href="https://github.com/shlomif/fc-solve/tree/master/nostalgia/perl">in
the “nostalgia” directory</a> of the version control system) was written
in Perl, but that was quickly rewritten in C. The original reason for the
rewrite was that the Perl version ran too slowly, but part of the problem was
the fact that it was poorly coded, rather than Perl’s fault.
</p>

<p>
I've kept the code written in C after version 0.2 which was written in C,
and have preferred to keep it in C, for performance reasons. Porting a
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/black-hole-solitaire-solver/">different
solver</a> I wrote - for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hole_%28solitaire%29">Black Hole
Solitaire</a> - from its initial Perl version
to C - made it roughly
<a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.culture.hackers.israel/2415">24
times faster</a> and I naturally find a 24 factor performance decrease
unacceptable.
</p>

<h3 id="algo">How does Freecell Solver solve Freecell? Which algorithm
does it use?</h3>

<p>
The exact algorithm used by “fc-solve” can be configured using the various
command line arguments it accepts, which are documented in the
<a href="$(ROOT)/docs/distro/README.html">README</a> and
<a href="$(ROOT)/docs/distro/USAGE.html">USAGE</a> files. Furthermore, the
“-l” flag can load some predefined configurations, which are essentially a
sequence of command line arguments loaded from a file.
</p>

<p>
Some of the highlights of the methods supported by Freecell Solver are:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
Switch-tasking in which different scans are interrupted, swapped with another
scan, and then resumed.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Randomised and/or prioritised depth-first-search (DFS) scans, and
Best-First-Search (BeFS) scans.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Different types of moves, with configurable order and grouping.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
One can instantiate different instances of the solver, that will each solve
different deals in different threads or processes.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<h3 id="input">How does Freecell Solver reads the cards and board layout? What
kind of input does it accept?</h3>

<p>
The API of the solver accepts a textual representation in a certain well-formed
format of the starting layout of the game's board (which may be a mid-play
layout), parses it, and starts the processing from it. This allows Freecell
Solver to accept any arbitrary layout, not just the initial layouts of Microsoft
Freecell or a different Solitaire implementation.
</p>

<p>
We did not bother with graphically extracting the cards, because it is harder
to do, and would have limited the utility and generality of the solver.
Nevertheless, the solver can be input with a text layout based on that which
seems to be the approach taken by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGgnyysFNTQ">iPhone Freecell Bot</a> demo.
</p>

<p>
Note that Freecell Solver also ships with some programs that generate the
initial deals of some popular Solitaire implementations, and some
<a href="links.html#front_ends">implementations of Solitaire</a> provide
integration with Freecell Solver, that provides it with automated input, and
also uses its moves output to display the solution.
</p>

<h3 id="deal_11982">I found a solution for MS Deal No. 11,982 - should I
report it to you?</h3>

<p>
That deal was found to be impossible by most human
players, and all automated solvers that tried to solve it (including
<a href="https://github.com/boundedvariation/Freecell">a solver</a> which
is written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_%28programming_language%29">Haskell</a>,
which is a statically typed programming language that code that is written in
it tends to exhibit very few bugs.). Nevertheless, we would welcome a proof
to the contrary given it actually refers to the actual deal.
</p>

<p>
For the record, the card arrangement is:
</p>

<pre>
 --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --
 AH  AS  4H  AC  2D  6S  TS  JS
 3D  3H  QS  QC  8S  7H  AD  KS
 KD  6H  5S  4D  9H  JH  9S  3C
 JC  5D  5C  8C  9D  TD  KH  7C
 6C  2C  TH  QH  6D  TC  4S  7S
 JD  7D  8H  9C  2H  QD  4C  5H
 KC  8D  2S  3S
</pre>

<p>
Or arranged with the piles in each text line:
</p>

<pre>
: AH 3D KD JC 6C JD KC
: AS 3H 6H 5D 2C 7D 8D
: 4H QS 5S 5C TH 8H 2S
: AC QC 4D 8C QH 9C 3S
: 2D 8S 9H 9D 6D 2H
: 6S 7H JH TD TC QD
: TS AD 9S KH 4S 4C
: JS KS 3C 7C 7S 5H
</pre>

<p>
Here is a <a href="$(ROOT)/images/pysol-freecell-ms11982.png">screenshot
of that deal in PySol</a>.
</p>

<p>
If, and only if, the cards match, please record a solution using
<a href="http://pysolfc.sourceforge.net/">PySol FC</a> and send us the saved
game. Make sure you are playing Freecell with exactly four reserves and not some other
variant.
</p>

<p>
Note that
<a href="https://www.makorrishon.co.il/nrg/online/10/ART/939/623.html">NRG
Israel reported</a> (in Hebrew) that an Israeli couple was able to solve
deal no. 11,982 but they didn't record the solution, and it is possible that
it exploited a bug in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FreeCell">MS Freecell</a>.

<h3_section id="complexity" title="What is the runtime complexity of solving Freecell?">

<p>
Generalised Freecell (where there is an
arbitrary number of ranks) was shown to be
an <a href="https://github.com/shlomif/Freenode-programming-channel-FAQ/blob/master/FAQ.mdwn#what-do-np-complete-np-hard-etc-mean">NP-complete problem</a>
and as a result, it is likely that no efficient solution for solving that
in the general case can be found (but it is possible that some good heuristics
can be devised).
</p>

<p>
That put aside, Freecell is a degenerate case where the number of ranks is
fixed at 13 (ace-to-king).
</p>

</h3_section>

<h3_section id="what_is_pysol" title="What is PySol? What is PySol FC? Are they solvers as well?">

<p>
No, actually <a href="http://pysolfc.sourceforge.net/">PySol FC</a>, which
is short for "Python Solitaire Fan Club edition" is an open source suite of
card solitaire / patience games, which includes, but is not limited to several
Freecell-like variants. While it includes some solver and hints functionality
and makes use of Freecell Solver and other solvers, it contains many other
features including allowing a human to play the games on their own.
</p>

<p>
Note that Shlomi Fish, who is the chief maintainer of Freecell Solver, also
co-maintains PySol FC so he tends to talk about his work on both.

<h3_section id="is_freecell_the_ms_game" title="“Freecell”? Is it the Microsoft/Windows game?">

<p>
Yes, and no. The "Freecell" game (see its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCell">wikipedia entry</a>)
was invented by Paul Alfille based on an earlier game called "Baker's Game"
and was implemented for the PLATO educational computer system back in 1978. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FreeCell">Microsoft Windows Freecell</a>
implementation came later and made the game much more well-known
and popular, but had some limitations. While Freecell Solver can handle the
MS FreeCell deals, parameters and rules perfectly fine, it also has run-time
support for many variations on them, and accepts any arbitrary layout of the
cards, including those at mid play, as input.

<h3_section id="exceeded_512GB" title="What were the whereabouts of one of the solvers running out of 512 GB (= gigabyte) of RAM?">

<p>
We were trying to conclusively determine whether MS deal no. 384,243 was
<a href="http://fc-solve.blogspot.com/2012/09/two-freecell-solvability-report-for.html">winnable or impossible to solve with <b>two</b> freecells</a>.
This was done by running the depth_dbm_fc_solver on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer">HPC</a>
node which used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64">x86-64</a> processors
and had 512 gigabytes of RAM. We were given indirect access to it thanks
to a certain university. Note that steps were taken to reduce the RAM
consumption and it seems unlikely that there were memory leaks in the code.
</p>

<p>
We have been able to complete a <a href="$(ROOT)/charts/fc-pro--4fc-deals-solvability--report/">complete scan of all 4 freecell deals in the MS freecell 8.6
milliard range</a> using an AWS node with only 256 GB of RAM and about
40-50 GB of hard disk (though we could probably use less or make use
of <a href="https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse">s3fs-fuse</a> or similar
— to save on costs).
</p>

<p>
It is true that
<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Bill_Gates#Misattributed">a quote mis-attributed to Bill Gates</a>
says “640 kB [of RAM] ought to be enough for anybody” but many computing
tasks require much more than that and Freecell is <a href="#complexity">a hard
(NP-complete) problem</a>. There may be ways to reduce RAM consumption further
using a different algorithm, by distributing calculations, or other techniques.
As usual, patches/<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/">pull requests</a> or ideas are welcome.
