<b>4-July-2009</b>: development of Freecell Solver was now resumed. There
have been a few stable releases with new features, and Freecell Solver
is under active development again. As a result, this page is no longer
relevant.

<p>
Due to the fact that the last stable branch of Freecell Solver was released
a few years ago (on 28-September-2002), one might get the impression that
Freecell Solver is a "dead" project. However, the real status is a bit more
complex than that.
</p>

<p>
First of all, Freecell Solver 2.8.x is <b>more than good enough</b> as it is.
It is very fast, powerful, usable, configurable, portable and can easily be
installed and packaged. See its <a href="features.html">Features List</a> for
more information. No other Solitaire solver is even remotely close to it
in most regards. So you shouldn't think twice before using or deploying it.
</p>

<p>
The reason a new stable branch (2.10.x or whatever) was not released was
because Freecell Solver's primary author - Shlomi Fish - has lost interest
in the project, and is only fixing bugs in the 2.8.x branch, if such bugs
are discovered. He has meanwhile moved to work on new and exciting projects,
and no-one has volunteered to advance Freecell Solver.
</p>

<p>
Fish is willing to help any volunteers who wish to continue working on the
library. It <a href="getting-credit.html">can also serve as a good
students' project to get academic credit for</a>, and Shlomi is willing to
provide any reasonable mental aid for that.
