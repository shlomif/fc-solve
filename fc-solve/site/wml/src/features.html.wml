<latemp_subject "Freecell Solver's Features List" />

<h2>Usability Options</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
The stacks and freecells retain their position throughout the
presented solution.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Can present either the intermediate states (stepping at one move or sequence
move) or the moves that are required for the solution, or both.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
On UNIX-like operating systems: accepts some user signal combinations that
turn some run-time debugging information on and off.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Some configurations are very fast: the solver was able to solve the first
Microsoft Freecell 32,000 deals in 74 seconds on a Pentium 4-2.4 GHz computer
(432 layouts per second), before that computer was decommissioned.
On a Core i3 computer, these deals are now solved in 3.04 seconds (10,526
layouts per second).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Option to use atomic moves which guarantee an accurate verdict.
(non-atomic scans may report a false negative)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Ability to read command line arguments from a file, or from a preset
collection. Makes command lines much less verbose.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
An optional <code>--hint-on-intractable</code> flag which
presents the moves to the intermediate reached state, if the maximal number
of iterations was reached without a conclusion (= "intractable").
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<h2>Development Features</h2>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
Available as a library for use within third-party applications. It is
licensed under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">the
MIT/Expat License</a>, which means it can be used without any restrictions.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The core library and program is written in C code supported by modern C
compilers such as GCC and LLVM/clang.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Full compatibility between dynamically-linked third-party applications to the
version of the library that is used.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Compile-time options for hard-coding several game-types parameters, that
can make the solver faster. There's a combined FCS_FREECELL_ONLY mode.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
A test suite is included as part of the distribution.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<h2>Scan Options</h2>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
Supports the DFS (= Depth-First Search), Randomized DFS and Best-First-Search
scans. Which one can be specified at run-time.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The order of the tests to be conducted on a given state can be specified at
the beginning of the scan. It is also possible to include only a subset of
the available tests.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
With the A* scan, one can specify the weights of the different state
evaluation parameters.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
One can limit the scan to a certain number of checked states.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
It is possible to resume a scan from a pre-empted position.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
After a solution path was found it can be optimized using a BrFS
(= Breadth-First Search) scan on the intermediate states.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
There is an option to reparent states during a scan if their depth in
the solution tree is higher than the one with which they were reached. This
also tends to shorten the solution length.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The Randomized DFS scan accepts a user-defined seed.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Several scans can be played on the same states' collection (while switching
from scan to scan) giving on average a faster solving time.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
It is possible to specify a static prelude of quotas to be played before the
perpetual loop.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
With the random-DFS scan, it is possible to specify a different moves selection
for each depth in the DFS stack.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<h2>Game Types</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
Can solve games whose sequences are built by suit, by alternate colour or
by rank regardless of colour.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Can solve games whose sequence move is limited by the number of Freecells
and empty columns, or unlimited.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Can solve games whose vacant columns can be filled by any card, by kings
only, or by no card whatsoever.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Run-time choice of the number of freecells and columns.
(limited by a compile-time directive)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Supports games of one and two decks.
</p>
</li>
