<h2 id="note">Recent Note (09-July-2009)</h2>

<p>
The contents of this page have become largely irrelevant with the
more recent development of
<a href="http://pysolfc.sourceforge.net/">PySolFC</a> and its integration
with Freecell Solver. The PySolFC developers took a different approach than
mine and relied on calling the fc-solve executable for solving the layouts
of the Solitaire games. Nevertheless, it's a valid approach and Freecell
Solver works beautifully there.
</p>

<p>
<b>Update:</b> see the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/freecell-solver/">PyPI freecell-solver</a>
module based on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/cffi/">cffi</a> which recent versions
of PySolFC can make use of for solving more quickly.
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This is code that enables Freecell Solver integration with
<a href="http://pysolfc.sourceforge.net/">PySol</a>,
an excellent cross-platform Solitaire Suite written in Python.
</p>

Python bindings for Freecell Solver. Can be built as an RPM. Requires
Freecell Solver.

Patch for PySol 4.82 to enable Freecell Solver integration. PySol will use
Freecell Solver only if the Python bindings are installed.

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
I assume you already have Python, PySol and all of their
requisites installed. First, install Freecell Solver. Afterwards compile
the Python bindings for it. Afterwards download the PySol source from
<a href="http://pysolfc.sourceforge.net/">its homepage</a>,
apply the patch, and invoke pysol from that directory.
</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>
The current integration still leaves a lot to be desired. I haven't yet
enabled the use of Freecell Solver for Der Katzenschwanz and Die Schlange
, as well as all the pseudo-Freecell games like Cruel, Good Measure,
or Streets and Alleys. The latter may require translating moves
to single-card moves, as Freecell Solver may move the cards one sequence at
a time. Plus, Simple Simon cannot work because Freecell Solver
also moves non-homogeneous sequences as one, so it was not enabled at the
moment.
