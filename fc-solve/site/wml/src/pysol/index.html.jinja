<h2 id="note">Recent Note (09-July-2009)</h2>

<p>
The contents of this page have become largely irrelevant with the
more recent development of
<a href="http://pysolfc.sourceforge.net/">PySolFC</a> and its integration
with Freecell Solver. The PySolFC developers took a different approach than
mine and relied on calling the fc-solve executable for solving the layouts
of the Solitaire games. Nevertheless, it's a valid approach and Freecell
Solver works beautifully there.
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This is code that enables Freecell Solver integration with
<a href="http://pysolfc.sourceforge.net/">PySol</a>,
an excellent cross-platform Solitaire Suite written in Python.
</p>

<h2>Files to Download</h2>

<table class="downloads">

<a href="FreecellSolver-0.2.0.tar.gz">FreecellSolver-0.2.0.tar.gz</a>
</td>
<td>
Python bindings for Freecell Solver. Can be built as an RPM. Requires
Freecell Solver.

<a href="pysol-4.82-fcs-patch-0.2.0.diff">pysol-4.82-fcs-patch-0.2.0.diff</a>
</td>
<td>
Patch for PySol 4.82 to enable Freecell Solver integration. PySol will use
Freecell Solver only if the Python bindings are installed.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
I assume you already have Python, PySol and all of their
requisites installed. First, install Freecell Solver. Afterwards compile
the Python bindings for it. Afterwards download the PySol source from
<a href="http://pysolfc.sourceforge.net/">its homepage</a>,
apply the patch, and invoke pysol from that directory.
</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>
The current integration still leaves a lot to be desired. I haven't yet
enabled the use of Freecell Solver for Der Katzenschwanz and Die Schlange
, as well as all the pseudo-Freecell games like Cruel, Good Measure,
or Streets and Alleys. The latter may require translating moves
to single-card moves, as Freecell Solver may move the cards one sequence at
a time. Plus, Simple Simon cannot work because Freecell Solver
also moves non-homogeneous sequences as one, so it was not enabled at the
moment.
