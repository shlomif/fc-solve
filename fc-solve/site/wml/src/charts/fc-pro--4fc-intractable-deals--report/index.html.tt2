Theodore Pringle had posted <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/fc-solve-discuss/conversations/messages/1466">an announcement</a>
to the "fc-solve-discuss" group, where he said that he ran a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCell">Freecell</a> solver over all
the deals in the 8 milliard (1 to 8,589,934,591)
<a href="http://cards.wikia.com/wiki/FreeCell_Pro">Freecell Pro</a> deals range
which are based on the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FreeCell">Microsoft FreeCell</a> dealing.
He ended up discovering that there are 102,032
impossible deals and 46 intractable deals. Further analysis reduced the number
of intractable deals down to 9 - see
<a href="https://github.com/shlomif/freecell-pro-intractable-deals">the updated
list</a>.
</p>

<p>
I (= Shlomi Fish) set out to determine the solvability of these intractable
deals while using
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</a>'s
depth_dbm_fc_solver, which is a solver which occupies relatively
little RAM, and aims to completely scan all positions in a board and
conclusively determine whether it is solvable or not. That solver was ran on an
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services (“AWS”)</a> EC2 node
with 256 GB of RAM. (Thanks to Jonathan Ringstad for the suggestion to use
AWS.)

Deals 219837216, 1252215044, 2255988055, 2901685480, 2902413565, 4260084873,
6687921694, and 7489392343 were <b>shown to be impossible</b> by the solver.
Deal 6825625742 ran out of hard disk space (we were given only 8 GB of disk
space by default, which turned out to not be enough), and appears to be
impossible as well, but not yet provably so.

<p>
This space will be filled with the contemporary statistics of the total
number and percentage of impossible and solvable deals out of the 8.5 milliard
deals.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise note that one surprising fact is that solving 4-freecells deals was
much easier for us to do programatically than solving the same
2-freecells deals. An
<a href="http://fc-solve.blogspot.co.il/2012/09/two-freecell-solvability-report-for.html">earlier report</a>
about their statistics, ran into more difficulties solving the first 400,000
2-freecells deals, which is a deals’ space smaller by over 4 orders of
magnitude. Perhaps this can be explained by the fact that many more deals
are winnable using 4 freecells.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> the depth_dbm_fc_solver uses a variation on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">breadth-first
search</a> where we keep a queue of items to check and check an iterations
count of states. The x-axis - "Iterations" roughly corresponds to time while
the y-axis, corresponds to the number of states in the queue.
