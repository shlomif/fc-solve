This is the source code for the famous Freecell solver by
<a href="http://www.icynic.com/~don/">Don Woods</a> (also see
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Woods_(programmer)">his Wikipedia
page</a>). It is basically
4 different solvers for four different Freecell variants which are
using a very similar algorithm. Maybe it is possible to abstract
the game rules and integrate all of them into one solver.
