<!-- TITLE=Freecell Solver 3.4.0 was Released-->
<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a> version 3.4.0
has been released. It is available in the form of a source tarball from
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/download.html">the
    download page</a>.
</p>

<p>
In this release, we've added the <tt>--set-pruning</tt> flag to turn on
the Horne's play prune, which improves performance. There are two new presets
- <tt>-l enlightened-ostrich</tt> (or <tt>-l eo</tt> for short), which makes
use of <tt>--set-pruning</tt> and is the fastest preset yet, and
<tt>-l maliciously-obscure</tt> (<tt>-l mo</tt>) which is slow but generates
especially short solutions.
</p>

<p>
We added a compile-time option to use
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/to-do.html#rcs_state_storage">RCS-like
    states storage</a> which conserves a lot of RAM and allowed Freecell
Solver to scale to over 200 million positions on an x86-64 machine with
64 GB of RAM (which was utilised for that courtesy of Amadiro's university).
There are many other major and minor speed and memory optimisations in this
release.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>--ms</tt> and <tt>-M</tt> flags were added to
the <tt>make_pysol_freecell_board.py</tt> program, to generate Microsoft
deals even for numbers higher than 32,000, which are different in
PySol and PySolFC. Furthermore, the CMake configuration was updated to
use "lib${LIB_SUFFIX}", so it can be built on some 64-bit systems.
</p>

<p>
Finally, there's an experimental <tt>--trim-max-stored-states</tt> which
currently may crash the solver, but we decided to release it despite this fact.
</p>

<p>
All of these changes prove to be a huge step forward for Freecell Solver making
this release its best release yet.
