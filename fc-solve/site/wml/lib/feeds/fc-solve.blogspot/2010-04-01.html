<b>01-April-2010:</b> Freecell Solver Enterprises™, Inc., on behalf of the
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver™</a> development
team, is glad to announce the upcoming availability of Freecell Solver™
Enterprise Edition. In its Enterprise Edition, Freecell Solver™ will be
enhanced to solve generalised Freecell, in which there can be an arbitrary
number of card ranks. Since generalised Freecell is <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete">NP-complete</a>. This will 
allow us to use Freecell Solver™'s ingenious, cutting-edge algorithms to 
solve the previously hard, provably NP-Complete problems of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">the
Travelling Salesman problem</a>, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem">Subset sum</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku">Sudoku</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_content_management">Enterprise
content management</a>.
</p>

<p>
Since we expect some of our customers to wish to solve NP-complete problems
with data sets of an order larger than the standard computer word (32-bit or
64-bit), we are going to start using 
<a href="http://gmplib.org/">the "GNU MP Bignum Library" (GMP)</a>. As our
CTO, Ron Johnson, says <q>By making use of Freecell Solver™ Enterprise 
Edition's sophisticated algorithms, we expect a cluster of 2,000 32-way
high-performance supercomputers to solve a 17,179,869,184 (2 to the power of 34)
problem, a short time before the heat death of the universe.</q> 
</p>

<p>
That's not the only change expected in Freecell Solver™ Enterprise Edition.
Until now Freecell Solver™ was written in ANSI C and was dependent only on
the standard C library. To make it more enterprise ready, we decided to convert
to such enterprise-ready languages as C++ and Java, and to utilise such
enterprise-ready 
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/portability-libs/">Cross-Platform 
    Abstraction Libraries</a> such as Boost, Qt, glib, Apache's Portable 
Runtime (APR), or ACE. Our CTO continues: <q>Phil Greenspun 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_Tenth_Rule">said</a>
that <q>Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, 
informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of 
Common Lisp.</q>. Well, now Freecell Solver™ will contain an
ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden and slow, but 
<b>enterprise ready</b>, implementation of half of Common Lisp. This
is really very exciting.</q> We don't know yet which of these libraries
we are going to use, but we are likely to use more than one based on the
enterprise-readiness of their individual components.
</p>

<p>
Naturally, as the company behind Freecell Solver™ Enterprise Edition,
Freecell Solver Enterprises™ does not expect to keep Freecell Solver™'s 
original
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_free_software_licence">permissive</a>
licence, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT/X11 
    License</a>, because code which is licensed under it is easy to abuse, 
misuse, and generally use. Instead, the core Freecell Solver™ Enterprise 
Edition functionality would be available under the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License">Affero
    General Public License (AGPL) version 3</a>, while making some extended
functionality available only under own own custom, proprietary licence -
exclusively for paying customers. We are really excited about this change 
which will
allow use to protect our 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html">intellectual
    property</a> from people and enterprises who will abuse, misuse or 
generally just use it.

Here is what others say about that:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    <p><b>Don Knuth:</b> <q>Freecell Solver™ Enterprise Edition really 
        excites me. I didn't think I'll see the day to see an Enterprise-ready
        NP-complete solver, but Freecell Solver™ EE made it happen. I can't
    wait to play with it.</q>
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><b>Larry Wall:</b> <q>Freecell Solver™ Enterprise Edition is the
        epitome of Laziness and Hubris, but unfortunately requires a lot of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patience_%28game%29">Patience</a>.</q>
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><b>Bill and Ted:</b> <q>Enterprise Content Management! Yeah!!! Star 
        Trek is Excellent, bro. Excellent!!! So where's Captain Kirk?</q>
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><b>Shlomi Fish (the original creator of Freecell Solver):</b> 
    <q>Eh, what the hell?</q>
    </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
As you can see, everybody are united in their opinion that Freecell Solver™
Enterprise Edition is the best thing since Enterprise bread came sliced
by and for enterprises.

<p>
One can <a href="http://prdownload.berlios.de/fc-solve/Freecell-Solver-Enterprise-Edition-1.0.0.tar.bz2">download the Freecell Solver™ Enterprise Edition
    version 1.0.0 source tarball</a>, and after resolving all the 
<b>essential</b> 
dependencies and building it (as documented in the <tt>INSTALL</tt> file),
type <tt>./fc-solve --help-enterprise</tt> to get help for the enterprise
features.
