Pressing
--------

* Fix the missing files (the presets one) on Windows due to the NullSoft
installer not packaging them.
** Make sure they are referenced correctly from the prefix.
*** ( Possibly using the Win32/Win64 registry.)

* Fix the STDERR message on fc-solve.exe startup on Windows to not suggest
that they should type fc-solve --help in that window.

Non-pressing
------------

* Make sure the depth_dbm_fc_solver is working on 32-bit architectures.

* See if GCC_INLINE-ing the functions inside fcs_hash.c will yield
any benefit.

* Refer to +expand-solitaire-multi-card-moves+ from the fc-solve process.

* Create a displayer for fc-solve's solutions which will allow seeing where a
card was moved from (using a colored →) and where it was placed.
** Create a GUI version.

* If +-opt+ is specified for the flare, then make sure that if the flares
loop stop it when it's doing the optimization scan, then the optimization scan
goes on until it ends.
** Not sure about it.

* Investigate a way to have positions_by_rank also index according to the
suit, and to traverse only the possible parents or children based on the
suit.

* Investigate ways to perform more pointer arithematics and
(ptr < end_ptr) ; ptr++ . A lot of code is under-optimized this way.

* In the states handling, there's still some room for pointer arithmetics.

* Implement more of Kevin Atkinson's Common Lisp solver's atomic move types,
and try to construct good heuristics out of them.

* Play with writing a memory-re-cycling Soft-DFS scan: if a sub-tree was
marked as a dead-end, then its states might be able to be placed on a linked
list of states that can be reused.

However this scan generates takes too much time for most boards (over 100K
iterations).

--------------------------------------------------------

** Shlomi Fish solved it in 92 moves.

* Add the new Freecell Solver-compatible game variants of PySolFC.

* Convert magic rank constants such as 1 or 13 to FCS_MAX_RANK and
FCS_RANK_ACE/etc.

Long-term
---------

* Integrate the patsolve's prioritization and mixed BFS/DFS scan.

* Update the architecture document.

* Make a super-strict parsable-output without all the quirks of
-p -t (see Games-Solitaire-Verify for why).
** Perhaps see: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/message/1264 .

* Write a multi-threaded version.

* Port to Java (?)

* Add a switch to ask the user if he wants to continue and enter a bigger
iterations limit.

* Check for unmalloced data and if so gracefully exit.

* Experiment with a delta-based state storage.
    - see delta_states_debondt.c - port it to the main libfreecell-solver.
    - see: http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/to-do.html#orig_calc_states .

* Make the dbm_fc_solver not dependent on http://gmplib.org/ by implementing
our own big ints.

* Adapt the scans based on the parameters of the initial board.
+
** Try to find a correlation between various parameters of the initial board
(such as those calculated in the A* scan or the number of steps required to
sort the cards in each column by rank), and the performance of various scans
and then:
+
1. Calculate the initial parameters on startup.
+
2. See what would be a good meta-scan based on them.
+
3. Use it.

* Unit-test +fc_solve_compare_lru_cache_keys+ in +scans.c+.

* Interactive mode? Continue a scan that reached its limit.

To be considered
----------------

* Make the code https://sourceforge.net/projects/splint/[splint]-clean.

* Write a multi-process client/server program.

* Add a limit to stacks number (in the case of Indirect Stack States),
number of states that are stored anywhere, etc.
