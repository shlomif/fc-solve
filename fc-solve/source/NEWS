Version 2.22.0 (31-Mar-2009)
----------------------------

1. Various improvements to the CMake build process:
    - Updated freecell-solver-config
    - Fixed the building if build from a different directory.
        (e.g: mkdir build ; cd build ; cmake ..)
    - Now also building a static library by default. There's a cmake option
    to trigger it off.
    - Thanks to RISKO Gergely (the maintainer of the Freecell Solver Debian 
    package) for a contributed patch.

2. Fixed the rpmbuild -tb process on Mandriva Linux Cooker (and 
possibly other systems).

3. Removed some old, unnecessary and/or no-longer-working files.

4. Converted the package from the Public Domain to the MIT/X11 Licence
( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License ). This change was done due to
the many problems with licensing source under the public domain:

Version 2.20.0 (26-Mar-2009)
----------------------------

1. Updated the "NEWS" file (this file) with all previous version up
to 0.4 (the first release after the first initial release).

2. Many fixes to the Win32 NSIS Package creation process of CMake/CPack .
The NSIS package is now built and installed properly.

3. Fixed a bug with the recycling logic of the optimization thread.

This influenced "freecell-solver-range-parallel-solve 1 2 1 -opt" among other
things. In the process, I refactored the code a bit after trying to follow
some false leads.

4. Fixed the --prefix flag in ./configure to be treated as a string instead
of a boolean.

5. Fixed the running of the executables under a specified PREFIX:

http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_RPATH_handling

6. Minor changes to "README", "INSTALL" and "USAGE".

Version 2.18.0 (19-Mar-2009)
----------------------------

1. Added the FCS_FREECELL_ONLY compile-time flag to hard-code the settings
for Freecell and thus allow faster run-time. On a Pentium 4-2.4GHz machine
running Mandriva Linux Cooker, this allows to solve the Microsoft 32,000 in 
194.56353 seconds ( 164 deals / second ) instead of 
228.84 seconds for the generic version ( 140 deals / second ).

2. Fixed using libredblack ( http://libredblack.sourceforge.net/ ) for states 
and stacks storage. (Compile-time options)

3. Added an option to use libJudy ( http://judy.sourceforge.net/ ) for states
and stacks storage. Yields better performance than libredblack, but worse
than the internal hash.

4. Added the -Wall by default for gcc in CMake.

5. Added the boards target to generate 24.board and 1941.board.

6. Updated the TODO file.

7. Added previous NEWS items for previous versions (in this file).

8. Now documenting the --version flag in USAGE.

9. Added an experimental ./configure convenience script (written in 
Perl) to run CMake using some configuration options. NOTE: Please don't 
use it to build packages.

10. Added "scripts/time-fcs.pl" to help time a 
freecell-solver-range-parallel-solve dump.

11. Got rid of the hard_dfs() scan. It is still accepted as an argument, but
is now using the soft_dfs() routines instead.

12. Many internal refactorings, cleanups tweaks and fine-tunings.

13. Moved away change_ver.sh to scripts/old/change_ver.sh - it does not
seem to be used any longer.

Version 2.16.0 (15-Mar-2009)
----------------------------

1. Made sure the indexes of the iterations when the "-s -i" flags are specified
are consecutive. Previously, they were much more inconsistent.

2. (Internals) Split ptr_state_with_locations_t into ptr_state_t (the key)
and ptr_state_extra_info_t (the value). Not all code inside the #ifdef's
(like the libavl / libredblack code) was ported to use it instead.

Version 2.14.0 (25-Jan-2009)
----------------------------

1. Fixed the compilation with profiling information in Makefile.gnu (should be
of concern only to developers). 

2. Optimized move_stack_cards_to_different_stacks, yielding a substantial
speed increase.

3. Converted the identifiers from starting with freecell_solver_ to 
starting with fc_solve_ , which is shorter and saner.

freecell_solver_user_ is still used in the API in order to not break
compatibility.

4. Made sure the effect of the "--sequence-move unlimited" option is not
dependent on other options, so the sequence move will always be unlimited.
(Thanks to larrysan for reporting this bug).

5. Fixed run-tests.pl (and as a result also ctest -V and make test) to
run properly after a raw unpacking.

Version 2.12.0 ( 10-Dec-2008)
-----------------------------

1. A New Configuration and buld system based on CMake 
( http://www.cmake.org/ ) which results in faster configurations
and builds, and a much reduced archive size.

2. There's a new suite of automated tests. See the file README for details
how to run them.

3. There's a new --version flag that prints the version of the library.

4. A speed optimization to the command line processing based on a radix-tree.

5. Many bug-fixes since 2.8.0. (Released as 2.8.x).

Version 2.8.0 ( 28-Sep-2002 )
-----------------------------

1. Better documentation and help screens. See: 

http://freshmeat.net/articles/time-to-rethink-your-help-flag

2. A preset system - see the "-l" flag in USAGE.

3. An option to read paramters from files. See "--read-from-file" in USAGE.

4. Finally, it is now possible to run one instance of the solver after the 
other in case the other one has returned a negative verdict. This is useful
for example to run an atomic moves preset after a meta-moves one, as the
latter cannot guarantee an accurate false verdict.

Version 2.6.0 ( 12-Jul-2002 )
-----------------------------

1. Atomic moves and some atomic moves presets have been added. Solving
using atomic moves guarantees that there will be no false negatives, but
is slower than the Meta-moves-based presets. (At least for now). It also
yields less interesting solutions.

2. There is now a "--prelude" switch (see USAGE) that allows running a 
static order of quotas at the beginning of the scan for the participating
soft threads. It makes constructing faster solving presets easier, especially
after utilising this code:

http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/fc-solve/trunk/fc-solve/presets/

Also see the "--st-name" option.

3. The PySol "Fan" game preset was added to make_pysol_freecell_board.py and
to Freecell Solver itself. Note that the game is played with 18 
columns/stacks , so Freecell Solver will usually need to be recompiled.

4. Several other command line options:
    - "--reparent-states"
    - "--calc-real-depth"
    - "--optimization-tests-order"
    - "--scans-synergy"

See the "USAGE" file for more information.

5. The internal code has undergone several speed boosts that made Freecell
Solver much faster. Now the INDIRECT_STACK_STATES is a bit faster than
COMPACT_STATES.

6. Updated the TODO list.

Version 2.4.0 ( 29-Mar-2002 )
-----------------------------

1. Now several scans are to operate on the same states' collection. This is 
done using a mechanism called "soft threads", which is switched in user-land
and does not require system multi-threading. In the file "USAGE" see:
    - "-nst"  / "--next-soft-thread"
    - "-nht"  / "--next-hard-thread"
    - "-step" / "--soft-thread-step"

2. fcs_cl.h was included in the RPM .spec.

Version 2.2.0 ( 18-Feb-2002 )
-----------------------------

1. Freecell Solver's version is now kept in the file ver.txt

2. Added manual pages symbolic links for the following command-line board
generators:
    - make-gnome-freecell-board
    - make_pysol_freecell_board.py
    - make-aisleriot-freecell-board 
    - pi-make-microsoft-freecell-board

3. Moved more declarations of functions to header files (ending with .h)

4. Added some compiler-optional inline annotations for functions.

5. The identifiers of the library are now all residing under freecell_solver_

6. New flag:
    - "--max-stored-states"

7. The package can now be built as an RPM for Red Hat Linux and compatible
systems by running rpmbuild -ta on the archive.

8. Several speed-ups.

Version 2.0.0 ( 19-Dec-2001 )
-----------------------------

1. Added some presets for the PySol games "Beleaguered Castle", "Citadel" 
and "Streets and Alleys".

2. Re-factoring of the scans code to make it simpler.

3. Added many functions to the external API.

4. fc-solve now uses it, so it is fully loosely-coupled with the library
it is linked against.

5. Added a randomized DFS scan (with a user-defined seed).

6. Win32 Makefile can now generate a working DLL.

Version 1.10.0 ( 02-Oct-2001 )
------------------------------

Added support for solving deals of "Simple Simon" in addition to
all the freecell-like variants that it could solve before.

Version 1.8.0 ( 31-Aug-2001 )
-----------------------------

1. A new build and configuration process based on the GNU Autotools (Autoconf,
Automake and libtool). This allows portably build shared and static libraries
and stuff like that.

2. The GNOME AisleRiot board-generation program can generate the boards of
the more Solitaire variants which are supported by Freecell Solver.

Version 1.6.0 ( 11-Apr-2001 )
-----------------------------

1. Freecell Solver now has a solution optimization scan. Check it out
by adding the "-opt" flag.

2. Many comments were added to the code, and you are welcome to go over
it and see if you understand everything that goes on there. If you don't,
contact me and I'll add some more comments.

3. Several speed optimizations were done in the internal hash, so I think
it should run at least a little faster.

Version 1.4.0 ( 07-Feb-2001 )
-----------------------------

1. Many fixes for bugs and memory leaks.

2. A Soft-DFS scan - Depth-First Search that does not use procedural recursion
was introduced.

3. A New Best-first Search Scan (called A* in the code and documentation was
introduced).

4. A New Breadth-First-Search (BFS or BrFS) scan was introduced. It's not
very practical.

The choice between all those scans can be specified at run-time using 
command-line arguments.

Version 1.2.0 ( 21-Dec-2000 )
-----------------------------

1. Several moves were improved or added, so it can solve more layouts.

2. A more robust command-line argument handling, so less segfaults can be
expected if it's improperly used.

Version 1.0.0 ( 19-Nov-2000 )
-----------------------------

1. Added support for solving more game types.

2. Can be compiled so it will be less memory intensive (INDIRECT_STACK_STATES).

3. There's an API for use by third-party developers. It suports
suspending a solution process and resuming it from its last position.

4. Several random bug-fixes.

Version 0.10.0 ( 09-Oct-2000 )
------------------------------

1. Support was added for several Solitaire variants besides Freecell, such as 
Forecell, Seahaven Towers and Eight Off. 

2. It now can emits the moves themselves, instead of just the intermediate
solutiosn.

3. Several bug-fixes.

Version 0.8.0 ( 28-Aug-2000 )
-----------------------------

1. Some bug-fixes. 

2. Support for a variable number of freecells, columns, and cards per column.

3. Board generators for Microsoft Freecell, Freecell Pro and PySol.

4. An option to use the balanced binary tree implementations of libavl
( http://adtinfo.org/ ), glib ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLib ), or 
libredblack ( http://libredblack.sourceforge.net/ ). Using them makes 
Freecell Solver about 33% faster.

5. Support for using "T" instead of "10" in board input/output.

6. Improved Documentation.

Version 0.6 ( 28-Jul-2000 )
---------------------------

1. An extra movement that allows Freecell Solver to solve some boards which
it could not solve previously.

2. The order of the stacks and freecells is preserved throughout the
solutions.

3. There is now in abilitiy to limit to a certain number of iterations (so 
Freecell Solver will stop before it consumes too much memory)

4. Specify the order of the movements that will be tested. Usually, a test 
order can be found that will solve a given board really quickly.

Version 0.4 ( 06-Jun-2000 )
---------------------------

1. Three major code optimizations. Freecell Solver now runs much faster.

2. Freecell Solver is now able to start solving from a non-initial board.
