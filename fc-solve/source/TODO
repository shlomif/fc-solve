--- Non-pressing ---

* Integrate the patsolve's prioritization and mixed BFS/DFS scan.

* Write a multi-process client/server program.

* Port to Java (?)

* Integrate into GNOME Freecell and/or GNOME AisleRiot and/or PySol.

* Code algorithms for similiar solitaire games. (maybe a perl program that 
generates C code). - DONE partialy

* Comment the code.

* Add a switch to ask the user if he wants to continue and enter a bigger 
iterations limit.

* Add a more verbose preset error handling. 
(explain why it could not be applied).

* Check for unmalloced data and if so gracefully exit.

* Add a limit to stacks number (in the case of Indirect Stack States),
number of states that are stored anywhere, etc.

* Experiment with a delta-based state storage.

* Code a generic tests grouping.

* Interactive mode? Continue a scan that reached its limit.
