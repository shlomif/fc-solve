solved by Freecell Solver.

Magnus Reftel - noting the correct procedure for calculating how many cards 
can be moved as a function of the free freecells and free stacks.

Colin Plumb - writing the MD5 code.

Ron Rivest - inventing the MD5 hashing algorithm.

Jim Horne - supplying the shuffling algorithm for 
Microsoft Freecell/Freecell Pro.

Tom Holroyd - sending several Seahaven Towers games which Freecell Solver
was unable to solve, thus making me improve the algorithm.

Markus F. X. J. Oberhumer - writing PySol on whose code the board generation
program for it is based. Also, contributing some patches.

Justin-Heyes Jones - wrote a nice introduction to the A* algorithm, and 
wrote the basis for the pqueue.c code.

KDE 2.1 and onwards; reported several bugs and memory leaks.

Michael Keller - Contributing some useful input about some minor features
lacking and the Spades/Clubs mix-up.

inspiration for the random-DFS scan of Freecell Solver.

Adrian Ettlinger - Integrating Freecell Solver into "Freecell Pro", and
contributing some input.

The perl 5.x Hackers - I copied its hash function.

Gergeley Kontra - wrote a Vim script to align text which I used.

Bob Jenkins - wrote the lookup2 hash function, which I now use as the
primary hash.

Tzafrir Cohen - His "RPM" lecture provided help in creating the RPM
Spec.

Yotam Rubin - Preparing an initial Debian Package.

Risko Gergely - Maintaining the current Debian Package.

Chris Moore - Pointing to an out-of-date comment regarding the 
MAX_NUM_CARDS_IN_A_STACK which I updated.

Anonymous (on http://xrl.us/h6ex ) - for pointing out the malloc.h and 
leading double underscores problems.

Con Radchenko - supplying a small patch, and reporting a bug with
"--method dfs", and supplying some other input. Integrated Freecell Solver
into http://pysolfc.sourceforge.net/ .

larrysan45 - reporting a problem with "--sequence-move unlimited"
and "--empty-stacks-filled-by kings", which resulted in a bug fix.

Ido Kanner ( http://ik.homelinux.org/ ) - reporting a segfault when running
freecell-solver-2.28.0 on x86-64, and allowing to diagnose it.
