Freecell Solver's Authors and Contributors List
-----------------------------------------------

* *Shlomi Fish* ( http://www.shlomifish.org/ ) - doing most of the work on 
Freecell Solver.

* *Eric Warmenhoven* - sending a program that generates the board of GNOME 
Freecell.

* *Hai Huang* - noting several boards of Microsoft Freecell that could not be
solved by Freecell Solver.

* *Magnus Reftel* - noting the correct procedure for calculating how many 
cards can be moved as a function of the free freecells and free stacks.

* *Colin Plumb* - writing the MD5 code.

* *Ron Rivest* - inventing the MD5 hashing algorithm.

* *Jim Horne* - supplying the shuffling algorithm for 
Microsoft Freecell/Freecell Pro.

* *Tom Holroyd* - sending several Seahaven Towers games which Freecell Solver
was unable to solve, thus making me improve the algorithm.

* *Markus F. X. J. Oberhumer* - writing PySol on whose code the board generation
program for it is based. Also, contributing some patches.

* *Justin-Heyes Jones* - wrote a nice introduction to the A* algorithm, and 
wrote the basis for the pqueue.c code.

* *Stephan Kulow* - integrated Freecell Solver into the kpat Solitaire suite for
KDE 2.1 and onwards; reported several bugs and memory leaks.

* *Michael Keller* - Contributing some useful input about some minor features
lacking and the Spades/Clubs mix-up.

* *GeYong* - He created Freecell Tool, whose randomized scan provided 
inspiration for the random-DFS scan of Freecell Solver.

* *Adrian Ettlinger* - Integrating Freecell Solver into "Freecell Pro", and
contributing some input.

* *The perl 5.x Hackers* - I copied its hash function.

* *Gergeley Kontra* - wrote a Vim script to align text which I used.

* *Bob Jenkins* - wrote the lookup2 hash function, which was used as 
the primary hash until reverted back to the perl 5.x hash.
(check http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/)

* *Tzafrir Cohen* - His "RPM" lecture provided help in creating the RPM
+.spec+ file and constructing RPMs (RPM Package Manager) for Freecell
Solver.

* *Yotam Rubin* - Preparing an initial Debian Package.

* *Risko Gergely* - Maintaining the current Debian Package and contributing
some patches to the CMake build system.

* *Chris Moore* - Pointing to an out-of-date comment regarding the 
+MAX_NUM_CARDS_IN_A_STACK+ which I updated.

* *Anonymous* (on http://xrl.us/h6ex ) - for pointing out the malloc.h and 
leading double underscores problems.

* *Con Radchenko* - supplying a small patch, and reporting a bug with
+--method dfs+, and supplying some other input. Integrated Freecell Solver
into http://pysolfc.sourceforge.net/ .

* *larrysan45* - reporting a problem with +--sequence-move unlimited+
and +--empty-stacks-filled-by kings+, which resulted in a bug fix.

* *Ido Kanner* ( http://ik.homelinux.org/ ) - reporting a segfault when running
freecell-solver-2.28.0 on x86-64, and allowing us to diagnose it. 

* *Gary Campbell* ( http://numin8r.us/ ) - participating in the mailing list
and inspiring some past (and possibly future) work on optimising the
length of the resultant solutions. He was given the honour of naming the
"sand-stone" and "slick-rock" "-l" presets. Has his own solver for
Freecell for DOS on his homepage.
