%description
The Freecell Solver package contains the fc-solve executable which is
a command-line program that can be used to solve games of Freecell and
similar card solitaire variants.

This package also contains command line executables to generate the initial
boards of several popular Freecell implementations.

%description -n libfreecell-solver0
Contains the Freecell Solver libraries that are used by some programs to solve
games of Freecell and similar variants of card solitaire.

This package is mandatory for the Freecell Solver executable too.

%description -n libfreecell-solver-devel
Freecell Solver is a library for automatically solving boards of Freecell and
similar variants of card Solitaire. This package contains the header files and
static libraries necessary for developing programs using Freecell Solver.

You should install it if you are a game developer who would like to use
Freecell Solver from within your programs.
