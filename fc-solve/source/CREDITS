Shlomi Fish (me) - doing most of the work on Freecell Solver.

Eric Warmenhoven - sending a program that generates the board of GNOME 
Freecell.

solved by Freecell Solver.

Magnus Reftel - noting the correct procedure for calculating how many cards 
can be moved as a function of the free freecells and free stacks.

Colin Plumb - writing the MD5 code.

Ron Rivest - inventing the MD5 hashing algorithm.

Jim Horne - supplying the shuffling algorithm for 
Microsoft Freecell/Freecell Pro.

Tom Holroyd - sending several Seahaven Towers games which Freecell Solver
was unable to solve, thus making me improve the algorithm.

Markus F. X. J. Oberhumer - writing PySol on whose code the board generation
program for it is based. Also, contributing some patches.

Justin-Heyes Jones - wrote a nice introduction to the A* algorithm, and 
wrote the basis for the pqueue.c code.

Stephan Kulow - integrated Freecell Solver into the kpat Solitaire suite for
KDE 2.1 and onwards; reported several bugs and memory leaks.

Michael Keller - Contributing some useful input about some minor features
lacking and the Spades/Clubs mix-up.

GeYong - He created Freecell Tool, whose randomized scan provided 
inspiration for the random-DFS scan of Freecell Solver.

Adrian Ettlinger - Integrating Freecell Solver into "Freecell Pro", and
contributing some input.

The perl 5.x Hackers - I copied its hash function.

Gergeley Kontra - wrote a Vim script to align text which I used.

Bob Jenkins - wrote the lookup2 hash function, which I now use as the
primary hash.
