* Add fcs_flip_top_card() to the things that are not done in FCS_FREECELL_ONLY.

* Change fc_solve_rand_alloc() away from malloc() into handling a pointer
to a rand_struct.

* Put the rest of the news (from http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/ ) inside the
NEWS file.

* Try to convert the macro-mania in tests.h (sfs_check_state_begin() /
sfs_check_state_end() ) to functions, and see if it actually makes it faster.

* Write automated tests for split_cmd_line.c .

* Make sure that "rpmbuild -tb freecell-solver....tar.bz2" works.
Right now, it only works if the .tar.gz is present.

* Experiment with getting rid of pointer to functions in the hash comparison
functions. They may incur a large run-time overhead. (inspired by Linux
kernel patterns from LWN.net).

* s/may be/maybe/ in +README.win32.txt+ .

* Update the "long solutions" help screen of fc-solve with the new presets.

* Deal with the inability to "make package_source" inside an unpacked
.../freecell-solver-x.y.z/ directory.

* Make sure that we can build Freecell Solver inside a ./build directory
without relying on asciidoc.

* Abstract away the hash changes for the columns-vs-states hash.
** Create an enum for choosing which one.

* Investigate +pi-make-microsoft-freecell-board 254076 | fc-solve -l by+ -
it should be solvable.

* Convert the +char * []+ arrays in the fcs_cl.h etc. to
+const char * []+ (arrays of constant strings). Its use is a relic of
+char * argv[]+ being non-const and having them as constant will bring many
advantages.

* Check that AsciiDoc is not required for preparing an .rpm (using a
test script.)

* Handle the case where the instance->hard_threads are re-allocated and
the pointers from the soft_threads to them are not updated.

* Add a +-o+ option to fc-solve to output to a different file than stdout.

* Flares: make sure the empty/null plan generates a run-indef followed by
a checkpoint instead of just a run-indef.
** Correct the tests.

* Extract the common functionality out of both copies of the "initialise
new instance_item copies in +lib.c+ .
** Also the flares.

* Implement Gary Campbell's FCELL.COM's methodology of trying several
atomic scans in different instances (with bounded quotas) and picking the
shortest solution out of them all. Slow, but will produce highly short
solutions.
** Called Flares - we've started to implement them and should continue.
** See the Flares functional spec under ../docs

* Update fc-solve and friends to handle the "wrong-flares-plan" compilation
problem.

* Change "A*" in the code's comments to BeFS.

* Normalise the +_free()+ and +_finish()+ methods in regards to the previous
commits of the A* functionality.

* Implement Soft-DFS and Random-DFS as pointers to test functions, similar
to what was done in the BeFS/BFS scan. Currently there is this code there:

----------------
fc_solve_sfs_tests[tests_order_tests[
                        the_soft_dfs_info->test_index
                    ] & FCS_TEST_ORDER_NO_FLAGS_MASK]
----------------

* Convert some of the documentation to Perl-POD or DocBook.
** Converted to AsciiDoc, which can generate DocBook.

* Find a way to update the ChangeLog from the svn.
** Rejected per advice of http://producingoss.com/[Producing Open Source
Software]

* Convert the boolean values in the C code to a specialised boolean typedef
called +fcs_bool_t+, just so readers can tell they are booleans instead of
ints.

* Deal with the fact that:
+./freecell-solver-range-parallel-solve 1 100 1 -mi 1+ displays
"Unsolved Board" instead of "Intractable Board".

* Add a quick way to get rid of --fc-only from +./Tatzer -l p4b+ /
+./Tatzer -l x64b+ .

* Add compact allocation for the Breadth-first-search (BrFS/BFS) queue
items.
** With recycling.

* Adapt more fcs_collectible_state_t * storage backends for FCS_RCS_STATES.
(libavl2 comes to mind.)

* Write a program to summarise an fc-solve invocation, giving the verdict,
validity, number of moves in the solution, number of iterations, and stored
states. It should be a wrapper for the fc-solve command line.
    - done: +scripts/summarize-fc-solve+ .

* Restore the old -mss flag behaviour and create a new trim-max-stored-states
flag where the new behaviour happens. max_stored_states should always increase,
and trim_max_stored_states should decrease if states were removed.

* Get rid of pushing an +FCS_MOVE_TYPE_CANONIZE+ move into each
+moves_to_parent+ moves stack and instead apply it upon recalculating
the derived state.

* Finish the conversion of the range solvers/etc. to +portable_int64.h+ and
+portable_time.h+ .

* Make sure the total_num_iters is only a 64-bit integer without an
intermediate 32-bit one - it just adds clutter to the code and is a premature
optimisation (and may be a de-optimisation).

* Add a BSD-licence-styled balanced binary tree implementation in the Freecell
Solver sources and have it use it for both stuff in the +--rcs+ option (and
possibly others)
** Kazlib's Red-Black tree looks like a good candidate.

* Implement the compact_allocators recycling in the remaining places in
the code.
** Already implemented for the hard_thread->allocator.

* Add an option to use nedtries (a +size_t+ -based trie) instead of libJudy
for the mapping backend of the LRU cache in scans.c.
    - rejected because it reportedely performs badly for large data sets.

* Add an +--ms+ / +-M+ flag to make_pysol_freecell_board.py to generate
the Microsoft (or pseudo-Microsoft) deals even for deals larger than 32,000.

* Optimize the Soft-DFS and Random-DFS tests_list implementation (direct
pointers to test functions).

* Refactor +scripts/parallel-range-solver-total+ - extract the section
marked as TODO .

* Make sure it also keeps track of min/max of the counts.

* Create a meaningful man-page from +README.xml+ / +USAGE.xml+ etc.

* Add some command line examples to +USAGE.txt+ .

* Also add the dead-ends trimming to the BeFS scan.
** Investigate the following crash:

--------------------------------------------------------
set args --method soft-dfs --st-name 'dfs' -nst --method a-star --st-name 'befs' --trim-max-stored-states 100 --prelude '200@befs,100@dfs,1000@befs,500000@dfs' -s -i -p -t -sam 1941.board
b main
r
b scans.c:1958 if (top_card_idx >= 7+12)
c
--------------------------------------------------------

* The cols_bit_mask_lengths in delta_states.c should be only the maximum,
because the columns can be rearranged.
    - or think about it.

* Make fcs_stack_compare GCC_INLINE.

* pi-make-microsoft-freecell-board 24 | ./fc-solve -p -t -s -i -sam -mi 50 -l eo -ni -l eo | grep Iteration | less
** Does not limit the iterations for the second instance.

* Fix the bug in commit No. 4345 also in the C code. Apply the patch and test
the FCC derived states list.
    - Done, but found that these two states are not equivalent whether in
    Perl or in C - another bug.

* Investigate why
+./dbm_fc_solver <(pi-make-microsoft-freecell-board -t 12064)+
finished after +Reached 3000000 ; States-in-collection: 3018329+ now
and not after +Reached 11600000 ; States-in-collection: 11617536+ in
r4339 when http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/message/1097
was reported.
    - I don't recall the exact specifics, but there were some code breakups
    and some compilation flags that did not play nice.

* FCC-Solver: also output the final iterations count, right before
the main function exits.

* Extract a function to do the prepare_state_s + initial_user_state_to_c +
encode_state all in one.
** It is fc_solve_user_INTERNAL_delta_states_enc_and_dec .

* Implement the FCC-based solver (Fully-connected components):
     - Test the out_num_positions_in_the_fcc.
     - Add more tests for fcc_brfs.

* Convert the +moves+ field of +fcs_fcc_moves_seq_t+ in +fcc_brfs_test.h+ to
a linked list of structs of 8 (number configurable) bytes and a next pointer
that are compactly allocated by a +meta_alloc.h+.

* Consider converting more linked lists+binary trees combinations in
+fcc_solver.c+ into only binary trees.

* Shove the signed char of the balance of libavl/avl.c into the
last char of the key_and_move_to_parent’s +fcs_encoded_state_buffer_t+. It
probably wastes some space due to struct alignment/parity.

* Compress the data in the offloading queue frames by storing only the
pointers instead of the whole +fcs_encoded_state_buffer_t+.

* See why +../Tatzer --num-stacks=13 --without-depth-field ..+ does not solve
the board
whereas +../Tatzer --num-stacks=13 ..+ does for
+./fc-solve -l mo -g bakers_dozen -sp r:tf -sam -s -i -p -t -sel -mi 500000 bakers_dozen-154.board+ .
The board is the output of +make_pysol_freecell_board.py -t 154 bakers_dozen+ .

* Create a small macro to test if a card is empty. There are a lot of places
in the code with +if ((fcs_card_card_num(top_card) == 0))+ / etc.

* Rename the occurences of fcs_card_card_num()/etc. to fcs_card_rank() which
is more standard terminology.

* Make the state input accept columns that start with a ":" at the beginning
of the line (for easier input).

* Try to convert the core libfreecell-solver code to meta_alloc and see if
it makes a difference in speed (rejected).

* Check for thread-safety of the meta_allocator construct in +dbm_fc_solver.c+.

* Prune for variants whose empty columns cannot be filled at all: there is
no point in moving the last card in a column to a parent on a different
column, because then the column won't be able to be filled and will be left
to disuse.
** See for example: Baker’s Dozen.

* Trap one of the UNIX signals in fc-solve to quit prematurely with a valid
footer of "Iterations limit reached"/etc.

* Create a more compact queue for +dbm_solver.c+ which has a header of the
next pointer to the item, some integers for start and finish within
the queue, as well as a vector/array of items that are extracted. Then the
segment is recycled as a whole.
** Possibly offload the queue segments to the hard disk.

* Adapt the new balanced binary tree to store entire encoded_keys instead of
pointers (to save space).

* Do the test for +SUSPEND_PROCESS+ (+check_if_limits_exceeded()+ ) in only
one place. There isn't a need for it to be done in several places.

* Remove "ST-Name:" from the debug output - we already have "Scan:".

* Make sure that run_hard_thread runs the soft_thread up to the limit of the
instance->num_times or the soft_thread's upper bound instead of entering
and exiting.

* Add an option to convert the stack_locs and fc_locs to a
MAX_NUM_STACKS-factorial permutation that can be stored compactly. (superseded
by the fc_locs/stack_locs elimination).

* With the +fc-solve+ command line program: add a flag to trigger different
notice on having reached +FCS_SUSPEND_PROCESS+. (Implemented as
+--show-extended-limits+ .)

* Experiment with using "selection sort" instead of "insertion sort" when
sorting small data sets (columns, freecells, derived states, etc.). (Insertion
sort is faster).

* Inline fc_solve_free_instance().

* Experiment with making fcs_move_t a bit-field with half-octets/etc. for
the various fields.
** Make sure that the amount required can fit there using CMake and a log2
function.
** Done in +internal_move_struct.h+.

* Divide the scan type variable into two variables: super-scan
(DFS vs BeFS/BFS/Opt) and sub-scan (random_dfs, soft_dfs, etc.), to facilitate
multiplexing them.

* See about getting rid of the unused context variable where appropriate.

* Add a way to build the various libavl2 trees to be used as
positions/columns collections.

* Play with moving commonly accessed struct elements to the start of
the struct to fit within the processor's cache line. Like the Linux kernel
where the most important elements are at the first 32 bytes of the struct.

* Experiment with using a union in the soft_thread to unify common elements
that are used only by one of the scans.

* Move the trunk, branches, tags, etc. to under /fc-solve. (?)

* Experiment with using bit members for cards:
** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_field

* Abstract away the move of a single card from one column to another
in freecell.c.
** [ Rejected. Does not appear to be a real need. ]

* Implement long/64-bit/intptr_t limits to the number of states/etc. to make
the code more 64-bit-enabled.
** Implement a 64-bit-ready callback.

* Translate the solution output of dbm_fc_solver / depth_dbm_fc_solver to
fc-solve for validation.
** Done: see +scripts/convert-dbm-fc-solver-solution-to-fc-solve-solution.pl+ .

* Added +expand-solitaire-multi-card-moves+ for expanding multi-card moves to
atomic, single-card, moves.

* [dbm_fc_solver]: create a different positions collection and queue for
every depth of non-reversible moves, and recycle the depths that were fully
traversed. This is similar to the FCC-fc-solver (FCC == fully connected
components), but without the costly FCC analysis.
** A bug:

----------------------

* Fix fc_solve_sfs_raymond_prune() (in libfrecell-solver) and horne_prune()
for non-Freecell variants.
** The prune should operate differently based on the how sequences are built.

* Implement the measurement of "non-reversibility" of the state inside
the befs_rater.
** This is a measurement of how many cards were moved to the foundations
and how many are not on top of designated parents. See the depth_dbm_solver.c
for more information.
**Done - to do so assign identical weights to the first and sixth BeFS
weights - +1,0,0,0,0,1+.

* Implement the parser for the state ordering based on arbitrary sortings.
** Like +--tests-order '[0123456789]=asw(depth=1)'+ .
** Done - with a different syntax +--tests-order '[0123456789]=asw(1,0,1,0)'+

* Cache the list of the empty stacks and empty freecells inside the
soft_thread for easy reference.
** Convert the freecell.c routines to use it.
** Tried it - it made the performance worse.

* Implement a --flares-iters-factor option for multiplying the iters count
allocated to each flare by a constant factor (so one can say make them times
10, or times 100 or times 0.5, etc.).
    - Test more thoroughly.

* Convert the functions in lib.c to do
+fcs_user_t * user = (fcs_user_t *)api_instance;+ .

* Investigate the scan of:
+--method random-dfs -to '[01]=rand()[23456789]=rand()' -dto '13,[0123456]=asw(1)' -sp r:tf+.
* It seems to yield good results.
** It generates a relatively short and a fast solution for MS #6240 , for
which "-l micro-finance" generates the longest solution out of the Microsoft
32K

* Add a FCS_2FC_FREECELL_ONLY macro for quickly solving 2 freecell games.
** Implements as -l ci7b -nfc=2

* Code a generic tests grouping.

* Convert the card initializers to an fcs_make_card constructor instead
of two separate set_rank and set_suit calls.

* Made sure the dbm_fc_solver and depth_dbm_fc_solver won't crash on 32-bit
machines (such as i386/i586/i686) due to trying to use the lower bits
of the pointers as flags for the AVL tree, and other fitting stuff into
pointers games.
** Test suite now passes on 32-bit architectures.

* Investigate the valgrind errors on processing layouts with 7 stacks
instead of 8 such as:

--------------------------------------------------------
5H QH 3C AC 3H 4H QD 4C
QC 9S 6H 9H 3S KS 3D 2C
5D 2S JC 5C JH 6D AS 9C

7H JS KH TS KC 7C QS
AH 5S 6S AD 8H JD 4S

--------------------------------------------------------

They shouldn't result in a different number of iterations.

* Add a textarea to specify arbitrary +fc-solve+ flags to the JS solver so
people can use it to solve other variants aside from Freecell, and for
other uses.

* Fix the missing files (the presets one) on Windows due to the NullSoft
installer not packaging them.
** Make sure they are referenced correctly from the prefix.
*** ( Possibly using the Win32/Win64 registry.)

* Fix the STDERR message on fc-solve.exe startup on Windows to not suggest
that they should type fc-solve --help in that window.
