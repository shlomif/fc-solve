* Add fcs_flip_top_card() to the things that are not done in FCS_FREECELL_ONLY.

* Change fc_solve_rand_alloc() away from malloc() into handling a pointer
to a rand_struct.

* Put the rest of the news (from http://fc-solve.berlios.de/ ) inside the
NEWS file.

* Try to convert the macro-mania in tests.h (sfs_check_state_begin() / 
sfs_check_state_end() ) to functions, and see if it actually makes it faster.

* Write automated tests for split_cmd_line.c . 

* Make sure that "rpmbuild -tb freecell-solver....tar.bz2" works.
Right now, it only works if the .tar.gz is present.

* Experiment with getting rid of pointer to functions in the hash comparison
functions. They may incur a large run-time overhead. (inspired by Linux
kernel patterns from LWN.net).

* s/may be/maybe/ in +README.win32.txt+ .

* Update the "long solutions" help screen of fc-solve with the new presets.

* Deal with the inability to "make package_source" inside an unpacked
.../freecell-solver-x.y.z/ directory.
