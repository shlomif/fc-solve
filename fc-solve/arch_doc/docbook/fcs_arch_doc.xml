            This is the architecture document of &fcs;. Its purpose is to
            serve as an introduction to the code, so future contributors can 
            understand it and work on it.

        <para>
            This document does not aim to cover every detail of the 
            application. Such details are supposed to be documented within
            the comments of the code. (let me know if there is something 
            there you don't understand, and I'll add a comment) Instead,
            it should provide an overview of the code and cover the main
            caveats one would encounter when trying to understand it.

            <title>Bottom-Up Design and Evolution</title>
            <para>

                &fcs; was designed bottom-up: first by writing functions to
                input cards and then to handle states and finally the algorithm
                itself. I find that bottom-up design (as evangelised by Paul
                Graham and others)- start by writing small utility functions
                and classes and then integrate into a grander scheme, has been
                a guiding principle when working on &fcs;.

            </para>
            <para>
                &fcs; has many utility classes, and has also been coded 
                incrementally. I also find bottom-up design more natural.

            <para>
                &fcs; is written in pure ANSI C and uses no gcc extensions, no 
                C99 or C++ extensions. I did allow myself to make use of
                <emphasis>inline</emphasis> in some places, but they are
                abstraced so they'll be used only with gcc or other supporting
                compilers. (see the "GCC_INLINE" macro).

            <para>
                &fcs; is actively compiled with gcc and with the Visual C++
                ANSI C compiler. I expect that it should be compilable with
                other open-source and proprietary compilers on various 
                systems. As this variety of compilers only support the bare 
                ANSI C standard, I have to stick to it. This is despite the 
                fact that such extensions may have made the code more
                optimised and my life as a programmer much easier.

                &fcs; is dependant on the ANSI C Standard Library as defined
                by the standard and on that library alone. The core FCS code is
                not dependant on glib, apr or any other abstraction or 
                encapsulation libraries of this kind.

            <para>
                &fcs; can optionally be compiled to make use of some binary
                trees and hash implementations found in external libraries.
                This serves as a drop-in replacement for its internal hash 
                implementation, which was shown to usually give a better 
                performance.

            <para>

                FCS makes a clear distinction between the internals of the
                program, that are subject to change from version to version,
                and between the interface supplied to the user or the
                application programmer. All the modules starting from
                <filename>instance.c</filename> and below are the internals of
                the program.

            </para>        
            <para>

                <filename>lib.c</filename> contain the API functions used by
                the programmer. <filename>cmd_line.c</filename> is an API to
                analyse a &fcs; command line. It itself uses only the
                <filename>lib.c</filename> API. It provides a more flexible
                interface for configuring &fcs;, even to the application
                programmer.

                &fcs; solves boards by using Depth-First Search or 
                Best-First-Search scans starting from the initial board. It 
                has a collection of the states, and constructs a tree of the 
                states descending from each state to its "parent". A parent
                state means the state in which from which it was discovered.
            </para>

            <para>

                &fcs; can run several "tests" on each state. Each test
                generates a list of derived states. Some of the tests are
                Freecell meta-move ones, some are Freecell atomic move ones,
                and the others are Simple Simon meta-move ones. The order of
                the tests can be specified at the command line, and tests can
                be grouped, and the order of checking of the tests within a
                group will be determined by a special callback.

            </para>
            <para>

                To perform the scans themselves Freecell Solver distinguishes
                between soft threads, hard threads and instances. An instance
                is a collection of states and an initial board to explore. Each
                instance may have several hard threads and each hard thread may
                have several soft threads. A hard thread is something that
                would likely be put in a system thread. It contains such
                resources, that a collision between them among several hard
                threads running in parallel is undesirable. Nevertheless, every
                hard thread can access the resources allocated by other hard
                threads, should it encounter them in its scan.

            </para>
            <para>

                A soft thread is a singular scan. It performs a scan for a 
                certain number of iterations, at which point the hard thread 
                switches to a different soft thread.

                <para>

                    It is still conceivable that the sprintf will generate a
                    long enough string that will cause a buffer overflow.
                    However, since the class is only used to render states into
                    strings, and the margin allowed for the buffer is long
                    enough, this cannot actually happen.

                    This module implemented indirect state allocation for

                    which have a fixed location in memory and allocates as

                    is conserved as an individually malloced state may have a
                    lot of overhead. (a malloced block+a fixed amount of data
                    is rounded to the nearest power of 2)

                As can be seen in <filename>state.h</filename>, &fcs; 
                supports three ways to represent a state:

                            This configuration consumes a lot of memory, and is 
                            the slowest of the three. It is however useful for 
                            debugging, as the debugger will display the state 
                            data-structure very nicely.

                            configuration the data is one buffer of chars,
                            where each card and each stack counter are 
                            represented as one character, and each freecell and 
                            foundation is one char too.

                            Determining the locations of every card is done 
                            using offset calculation.

                        <para>
                            This configuration consumes much less memory than 
                            Debug States, but it doesn't scale well to games 
                            where the stacks can contain a lot of cards.
                            The reason is that every stack be of a fixed size
                            (so offset would be determined by means of 
                            multiplication).

                            This configuration used to be the fastest for 
                            limited stack games such as Freecell. After 
                            &fcs; 2.6.x, it seems that Indirect Stack States 
                            has become slightly faster than it, too.

                            in this configuration 
                            each stack is a pointer to a stack in memory. 
                            The stacks are also collected and there is one copy
                            of each stack organisation (say [KS QH 6H]) in 
                            memory. Since a pointer to a stack uniquely 
                            identifies a stack, the states can be compared by
                            comparing their memory contents.

                            2.5.x development tree, many enhancements were done to 
                            optimise it. It was benchmarked to be slightly faster 
                            than Compact States, even for games like freecell.

                The stacks are kept in their own stack collection in the

                create a derived states, it first copies the state, and then 
                marks the flags of all the stacks as cleared. (check

                Later on when a stack is changed, its flag is set, and a

                The check_and_add_state function then, when checking a 
                new state, ignores those stacks whose flag was not set, 
                and collects the stacks whose flag was set.
                ( <symbol>(*Mark STACKS_COW_CACHING*)</symbol> ). The 
                memory for the collected stacks is allocated compactly in 
                a segment, where one stack starts after the other
                (check <filename>alloc.c</filename> and <filename>alloc.h</filename>). 
                If the stack was found in the collection the memory that was 
                allocated is freed for use by future stacks).

                For each position in the game graph, Freecell Solver maintains a

                stacks and freecells are uniquely sorted to avoid states that 
                are identical except for a different permutation of the stacks

                (--reparent-states) that specifies that if an existing state whose

                            normalisation is the opposite of canonisation. It is
                            meant to bring the stacks and freecells to their 
                            absolute locations. It is normally done only when
                            presenting a state to the user or to a code that
                            uses the API.
