                        An extended state is canonized by its stacks being
                        uniquely sorted according to their contents, and an
                        array of indexes describing their original locations
                        sorted accordingly. This is done to make sure no two
                        states with the same permutation of states exist.

                        can be solved in some way. A false impossible may be

                        uses the API.

                        Freecell Solver uses a 32-bit primary hash value. As
                        such it is susceptible to the birthday paradox starting
                        at about 2<superscript>16</superscript>. A secondary
                        hash value with extra 32-bits ensures a collision of both
                        hash values will only happen at around 2<superscript>32</superscript> states, 
                        which is much more states than most 32-bit systems can 
                        handle.

                        A depth-first search scan that does not utilize
                        procedural recursion. In &fcs;, this utilizes a stack
                        of records, each containing the current state, the
                        current test, the list of derived states, and other
                        information. This deviates from the standard scheme
                        that puts every state at the end of one stack scheme
                        (that exists in <ulink
                            url="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lm-solve/">LM-Solve</ulink>
                        for example) and is harder to maintain, but can be
                        fine-tuned and conserve resources more easily.

                        freecells, and foundations at any given time. A human
                        seeing a state can solve the game from it without
                        further information.

                        extra information such as depth, order of stacks and
                        freecells and others, so it is more of a key-value
                        collection.

                        are allocated as necessary. The implementation of State
