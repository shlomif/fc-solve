<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a> version 2.42.0
has been released. It is available in the form of a source tarball from 
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/download.html">the
    download page</a>. We hope to release a Windows binary soon.
</p>

<p>
This release finally adds a <tt>-o</tt>/<tt>--output</tt> flag to the 
"fc-solve" executable, and installs the newly created executables 
( freecell-solver-fc-pro-range-solve , freecell-solver-multi-thread-solve , 
freecell-solver-range-parallel-solve , etc.) by default. There are also several
bug-fixes and one can now input "const char *" instead of "char *" (with
a compile-time flag that typedefs the strings to their old interface).
</p>

<p>
There has been some internals cleanups and optimisations. Finally, 
the file <tt>pqueue.h</tt> was converted to the MIT/X11 license, with
permission of <a href="http://www.heyes-jones.com/">its originator, 
    Justin Heyes Jones</a> making Freecell Solver fully licensed under
MIT/X11.
</p>

<p>
We hope you have fun with this new release.
</p>
