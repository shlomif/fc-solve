<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a> version 2.36.0
has been released. It is available in the form of a source tarball from 
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/download.html">the
    download page</a>.
</p>

<p>
The main highlight of this release is that the plaintext documentation that
was part of the source distribution were converted to 
<a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/">AsciiDoc</a>, a lightweight
markup language that allows the plaintext and human-readable sources to
be converted to HTML, to DocBook/XML, to PDF and to other formats. As
a result, they are now also available online in HTML formats.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the process for getting the test suite and benchmarking process 
up and running were considerably simplified, thanks to the input received 
by <a href="http://pythack.com/">Dimitri Leca (Pythack)</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, there are some other more minor improvements. This release has 
been delayed quite a bit due to some neglect on the part of the main
maintainer, but we hope you find what's new satisfying enough. Happy solving!
