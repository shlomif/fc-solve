Subject: TAOUP: Review + Some Possible Addition to the Book
Date: Thu, 25 Dec 2003 01:50:37 +0200

I wrote a review for "The Art of UNIX Programming" (which I read online) here:

http://www.perl.org.il/kwiki/index.cgi?BookReviewTheArtOfUnixProgrammingByShlomif

Note that I personally have very much enjoyed the book and would highly 
recommend it. Still, the review contains some impressions, some of which are 
critical of it, so it's up to you to decide whether it is "raving" or "good", 
after you have read it.

Now, here's a possible addition, which I can warn you in advance that it 
refers to a software which I am its primary author. The program in question 
is Freecell Solver:

http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/freecell-solver/

Which is an ANSI C library and also standalone command line executable, that 
can be used to automatically solve several variants of Card Solitaire. It's 
not very long, only 15,000 or so lines. Now, the interesting thing about it 
was that between version 2.6.x and version 2.8.x (two consecutive stable 
releases) I only added usability features and did not touch the core at all. 
Here is a description of them, as they may prove of interest:

1. The revamp of the help system. Refer here:

http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/519/

For an editorial I wrote about it for Freshmeat. I analyze various ways of 
dealing with an inflation of command line options, and how to gracefully 
handle it.

Of course, seeing it in action may require installing Freecell Solver and 
playing a bit with it.

2. Displaying a message to standard error saying "we accept standard input 
now".

In the grand tradition of UNIX filters, I made Freecell Solver able to accept 
a board layout (of the Solitaire game) in the standard input if no board file 
is specified. I made it the default behaviour even if no "-" is specified.

The problem was that I also maintained some Win32 binaries of the program for 
people to download and got a lot of questions of the form:

	I downloaded Freecell Solver, unpacked it, double clicked it and it just
        opens an empty DOS box.

To resolve this problem (and also to help UNIX people for which Freecell 
Solver just gets stuck on the command line waiting for input), I printed this 
notice to standard error:

<<<
Reading the board from the standard input.
Type "fc-solve --help" for more usage information.
To cancel this message set the FREECELL_SOLVER_QUIET environment variable.
>>>

Which naturally, can be turned off by setting the appropriate environment 
variable. This has eliminated most such questions, albeit I still get 
questions from Windows people who are relatively clueless as far as using 
command line applications are concerned, which I happily instruct them how to 
use, or refer them to the WYSIWYG solution. (which I did not author entirely, 
or even initiated)

3. Using the command line arguments as a configuration language

Throughout its development, Freecell Solver collected more and more features, 
which added up to an accumulation of command line options. With the addition 
of the multiple scans operating on the same states collection in Freecell 
Solver 2.4.0 and later on the so-called "prelude" feature, it was possible to 
construct command lines and shell scripts to solve boards or ranges of boards 
quite efficiently on average. One preset is given here for illustration:

<<<
--method soft-dfs -to 0123456789 -step 500 --st-name 1 -nst \
--method soft-dfs -to 0123467 -step 500 --st-name 2 -nst \
--method random-dfs -seed 2 -to 0[01][23456789] -step 500 --st-name 3 -nst \
--method random-dfs -seed 1 -to 0[0123456789] -step 500 --st-name 4 -nst \
--method random-dfs -seed 3 -to 0[01][23467] -step 500 --st-name 5 -nst \
--method random-dfs -seed 4 -to 0[0123467] -step 500 --st-name 9 -nst \
--method random-dfs -to [01][23456789] -seed 8 -step 500 --st-name 10 -nst \
--method random-dfs -to [01][23456789] -seed 268 -step 500 --st-name 12 -nst \
--method a-star -asw 0.2,0.3,0.5,0,0 -step 500 --st-name 16 -nst \
--method a-star -to 0123467 -asw 0.5,0,0.3,0,0 -step 500 --st-name 18 -nst \
--method soft-dfs -to 0126394875 -step 500 --st-name 19 \
--prelude 
"350@2,350@5,350@9,350@12,350@2,350@10,350@3,350@9,350@5,350@18,350@2,
350@5,350@4,350@10,350@4,350@12,1050@9,700@18,350@10,350@5,350@2,350@10,1050@16,
350@2,700@4,350@10,1050@2,1400@3,350@18,1750@5,350@16,350@18,700@4,1050@12,2450@
5,1400@18,1050@2,1400@10,6300@1,4900@12,8050@18"
>>>

(seriously, I'm not kidding).

The problem is that it is quite uncivil to use on the command line at every 
time. To resolve it and also allow users to manage their own custom 
configurations like that, I added the following options to Freecell Solver:

1. a --read-from-file option that processes a file as if it was given on the 
command line. To implement it, I had to build a processor for a subset of the 
Bourne shell syntax. (which I have to admit is one of the hairiest pieces of 
code I had to write). This makes sure that the files are still usable as 
shell scripts should the user want to, or that he can copy and paste things 
from the command line.

2. A -l [configuration] option that loads a certain configuration. The 
configurations are specified in several presets files with simple formats 
that can are found in the system-wide installation, in an 
application-specific dot-directory under the home directory, and also in a 
place customizable via an environment variable.  There, the user can specify 
short commands to process in case the configuration's name is encountered, 
which usually will just read a more verbose file.

Using these two features it is possible in Freecell Solver 2.8.0 to abbreviate 
the command line above as:

$ fc-solve -l cool-jives

Or alternatively, use:

$ freecell-solver-range-parallel-solve 1 32000 1 -l cool-jives

To solve the Microsoft Freecell 32,000 boards really quickly. ;-)

This may be the case where the command line syntax of software that evolved, 
can eventually be used as a configuration language proper, without adding 
much more complexity to the program, that is necessary to create a 
configuration language analyzer.

Note that this later proved useful as I could configure a solver instance by 
passing along an argv/argc style array of strings. When coding the Python 
interface (which I aimed at providing integration of Freecell Solver into 
PySol), I was able to leave most configuration commands alone, and just keep 
the routine that configures an instance according to the command line 
arguments.

------

Other than that - thanks for a great book and other great work (I really 
enjoyed the CatB series, How to become a Hacker FAQ, and other resources on 
your sites, as well), and I hope you find my review and this commentary 
useful.
