<h1>Solvability Statistics of Two Freecell Games</h1>

<!-- Tags: freecell, solver, solving, two, deals, layouts, solvability, statistics

<p>
While the default 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCell_%28Windows%29">Windows 
implementation of Freecell</a> only supports playing Freecell with four initial
freecells, it can be played with any number of them. In order to make the
game more challenging, some people are playing it with a fewer number of
freecells.
</p>

<p>
As of today,
<a href="http://www.solitairelaboratory.com/fcfaq.html">the Freecell FAQ</a>
says that "With two freecells, there are at least 24,161 solvable deals [in
the Microsoft 32,000 deals].". However, at the course of researching those
layouts using <a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a> 
(after constructing a solver configuration optimised for solving two-freecell 
deals), we have found out that more deals can be provably solved.
</p>

<p>
Below one can find the report about the solvability of 2-freecell deals. The 
executive summary is that:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
25,367 deals were successfully solved.
</li>

<li>
6,600 deals are provably unsolvable.
</li>

<li>
The other 33 deals are "intractable" - meaning my computer ran out of 
resources trying to solve them (I limited the range of iterations to 
8,200,000, but some of them were killed by the "out-of-memory" daemon 
earlier).
</li>

</ol>

<p><b>Solvable</b></p>

<p><b>Conclusion and Future Directions</b></p>

<p>
The 33 deals that we could not determine whether they were unsolvable or not
are: 891, 982, 3129, 5435, 6090, 7214, 7728, 9034, 11266, 12038, 12064, 13659,
13705, 14262, 14445, 14790, 15804, 15957, 16322, 16462, 17184, 17684, 17760,
17880, 18446, 19671, 19678, 20792, 21779, 26124, 27799, 28188, 29577. We would
appreciate any further insights about whether they can be solved or not
and one option would be to use Freecell solver to solve them on a 64-bit
machine with more memory available than what I have.
</p>

<p>
In the future, we'd like to work on the 
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/to-do.html#orig_calc_states">"States
calculated from the original"</a> feature which should reduce 
memory consumption considerably, especially on 64-bit architectures. After
reading the report of <a href="http://kevin.atkinson.dhs.org/freecell/">Kevin
Atkinson's and Shari Holstege's solver</a> it seems that we can also
save space by re-using old positions that have been determined
to be dead-ends, so we'd like to explore that. We'd also
like to explore using an on-disk storage to store the states / positions 
such as <a href="http://1978th.net/tokyocabinet/">Tokyo Cabinet</a>. That or we
can try adding a bigger swap partition.
